        <p>The Raven by Edger Allen Poe depicts a dark and mysterious poem in which the speaker encounter with worries over a knocking at his door and a raven. He sketches the process of accepting the loss of his beloved Lenore with loads of literature techniques, especially the symbolism, in order to show his scare and terrify. Throughout the poem, it is easy to infer that Poe attaches importance to the raven because of using the repetition. Thus, the raven is not only a talking bird in physical life, but also a symbol of repetition and loss which expose the deeper themes of grief, self-analysis and rationality.</p>
<p>The theme of grief is the most obvious symbol embodied by the raven. Also, grief is the overwhelming emotion in The Raven in which the narrator is consumed by his grief for his lost love, Lenore. At the beginning of the poem, he tries to distract himself from his sadness by reading a “volume of forgotten lore”(Poe line2). Whereas, when the raven arrives, he immediately begins asking questions about Lenore and becomes further lost in his grief at the raven’s response of “nevermore.” By the end of the poem, the narrator is seemed to be broken (Poe line100), stating that his soul will never again be “lifted” due to his sorrow (Poe line108). Poe stated that the raven itself was a symbol of grief. As a result, the whole poem is all filled with the poet’s grief of losing Lenore.</p>
<p>The Raven centers around the theme of self-analysis explored by facing and accepting the raven as the poem progressed. When the speaker grows stronger soul, he hesitates no longer to open the door (Poe, line19) instead of keeping surceasing the sorrow by reading books (Poe, line10). This confirms his confidence to start looking at himself by facing the loss. Besides, he tries to figure out why the grief comes so poignant. He sits divining with his head at ease reclining towards the raven corroborating that he is analysis himself: confronting the loss, battling with his sorrow and even begin to think whether the loss will go (Poe line75). The entire poem is all developed by his gradually analytical thinking. In other words, his views of the lost Lenore is embodied by his dealing with the raven on the chamber door. The introspect of his suffering is also the struggle that sustains the progress of “The Raven”.</p>
<p>The theme of rationality of the speaker converts into irrationality little by little due to the raven. Primordially, the narrator is rational enough to understand that Lenore is dead and he will not see her again because he wants to “surcease sorrow for the lost Lenore” (Poe, line10). When the raven first begins repeating “nevermore,” he realizes that the answer is the bird’s “only stock and store,” (Poe, line62) and he will not get another response no matter what he asks. He seems to even find the bird vaguely amusing since the bird beguiling his sad fancy into smiling (Poe, line 43). However, as the poem continues, the narrator’s irrationality increases as he asks the raven questions and takes its repeat response of “nevermore” to be a logical answer and that resulting in further lost into madness. That is why he curses the bird as a “devil” and “thing of evil” and thinking he feels angels surrounding him before sinking into his grief (Poe line83). He has clearly come undone by the end of the poem. In “The Raven”, Poe wants to show the fine line between rational thought and irrationality is broken by the raven which keeps stimulating his deeper grief.</p>
<p>All these themes are emphasized by the speaker’s loneliness which the symbol of the raven brings along. The loss of Lenore results in the speaker’s getting stuck with his grief. He tries to control the sorrow by doing analytical thinking to himself, but unfortunately the only response to his questions of analysis is nevermore, which drive him mad and irrational. Facing the raven on the chamber door, listening the answer as nevermore, when will he accept the loss of Lenore.</p>
