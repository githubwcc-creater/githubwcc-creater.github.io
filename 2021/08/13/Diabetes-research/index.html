        <p>Types of Diabetes, Introduction to Causes and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes</p>
<p>Diabetes is an extremely common disease in today’s society. In recent decades, the number of diabetic patients worldwide has increased at an alarming rate, and it is a serious threat to human health. Why do people get diabetes? What is blood sugar level? The glucose flowing in the blood is referred to as blood sugar for short. Glucose is an indispensable source of energy for our physical and mental activities. Every second we breathe, every moment there is glucose flowing in our body. We call the glucose concentration in the blood the blood glucose level, and the unit generally used is mmol/L. Healthy people can control blood glucose fluctuations before and after eating. The blood sugar can be stabilized between 3.8~6.1mmol/L when fasting, and the blood sugar after eating will not exceed 7.8mmol/L. </p>
<p>How do people maintain stable blood sugar? This is due to several hormones in the human body: glucagon, insulin and adrenaline. When we feel hungry, or when we have just performed strenuous exercise and consume a lot of energy, blood sugar as a source of energy will be lacking, and the body will adjust to raise blood sugar levels accordingly. At this time, the two hormones glucagon and adrenaline will stimulate the body to produce glucose, and the blood sugar level will rise. As food is absorbed, starch and other products are decomposed into glucose, and the blood sugar level in the body will also increase, but these glucose will not be consumed immediately as energy. The excess glucose will be stored in the liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. If there is surplus in the cells, it will be converted into neutral fat and stored in fat cells. This process is called glucose metabolism. The hormone that is active in this metabolism is insulin. With its help, people can convert excess glucose into other forms and reduce blood sugar to the normal range. Insulin is the only hormone in the body that lowers blood sugar. Therefore, if insulin is not secreted enough, its work efficiency is not high, or the cells in the body are not sensitive enough to insulin (called “insulin resistance” in medicine), blood sugar will rise. </p>
<p>So what is insulin? Insulin is a heavy protein hormone. Secreted by pancreatic beta cells in the pancreas (process): The pancreas secretes insulin into the blood. Insulin circulates, allowing sugar to enter the cells, thereby reducing the sugar in the blood. As the blood sugar level drops, the secretion of insulin in the pancreas also drops. Glucose? Glucose is a simple sugar that is the main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose has two main sources: food and the liver. Sugar is absorbed into the blood and enters the cells with the help of insulin. Liver It can store and produce glucose. When the glucose level is low, for example, if there is no food for a period of time, the liver will break down the stored glycogen into glucose to keep the glucose level within the normal range.</p>
<p> Type 1 diabetes introduction and treatment</p>
<p>Type 1 diabetes is Autoimmune disease, also known as insulin-dependent diabetes or juvenile diabetes, patients are usually diagnosed with diabetes at a young age (mostly onset under the age of 40), under the age of 20 but not limited to this stage, any age is possible Suffer from type 1 diabetes. Unlike type 2 diabetes, the number of patients with type 1 diabetes only accounts for 5%-10% of diabetic patients. </p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes patients account for 95% of all diabetic patients. Compared with the cause of type 1 diabetes, according to the “Encyclopedia of Diabetes”, it is based on genetic factors through the action of environmental factors, leading to insulin resistance and insufficient insulin action Or due to the toxic effects of glucose. Causes: 1. Genetic mechanism: 1) Race prevalence (for example, the prevalence of diabetes in a certain race in the United States is as high as 35% after the age of 20, while the average prevalence of diabetes in the United States is 7%, but in mixed races This prevalence rate is similar to the average prevalence rate in the United States. 2) Family history/twin (one twin has type 1 diabetes, the other has a 40% chance of developing this disease; but if it is type 2 diabetes , The other has a 70% chance of developing type II diabetes.) 3) Single gene locus that is clearly related to the onset of diabetes: Insulin gene: hyperinsulinemia (amino acid variation in the original polypeptide chain of synthetic insulin, leading to Insulin-converting enzyme cannot act here to cause excessive proinsulin) Insulin receptor gene glucokinase gene mitochondrial gene mutation 2. Environmental factors 1) Obesity: A large amount of fat accumulation causes blood biochemical metabolism to be affected, and blood lipids are significantly increased. The content of free fatty acids increases; especially saturated fatty acids of this type of fatty acids will inhibit glucose from exerting its effects. 2) Age: a. With the increase of age, the pancreatic islet secretion capacity of the elderly is affected. On the one hand, the degeneration of pancreatic islet cells in the elderly increases, and the number of β cells decreases; functionally, the glucose transport ability of pancreatic islet cells is reduced, and the ability of glucose to induce insulin is also weakened. b. Insulin-mediated glucose uptake is reduced, which reduces the peripheral utilization of glucose: Most of these are in muscle tissue, which is the main peripheral tissue where insulin mediated glucose uptake. Muscle strength and mass will decrease with age. According to reports, human muscle tissue decreases by 30%-45% between the ages of 30 and 70. Adipose tissue increases by 18%-30% in men and 26% in women. 36%, the fat cell surface area increased by 19%, which is a reason for the decline in glucose utilization. Due to the decreased peripheral action of insulin, the inhibitory effect of insulin on glucose production in the liver is reduced, which increases liver glucose production. Symptoms related to type 2 diabetes: Polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, increased blood sugar, weight loss, visual impairment, gastrointestinal emptying, delayed wound healing, and type 2 diabetes treatment. The treatment goals of type 2 diabetes are mainly to increase insulin sensitivity and protect / Improve β cell function, reduce cardiovascular and microvascular complications, control glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism disorders. </p>
<p>One of the most effective methods is to increase insulin sensitivity. For patients who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, general treatment strategies include weight control and lifestyle improvements. Patients can relieve their symptoms by improving their diet, cooperating with exercise, taking drugs, injecting insulin, and performing surgery. I won’t go into details about diet and exercise here. In terms of drugs, the Ins metformin and sulfonylurea drugs invented in the last century are currently commonly used treatment drugs, but type 2 diabetes is still a very serious and incurable disease, so people are still working on research and testing more Program. The hope of curing diabetes is to reshape patients’ sensitivity to insulin. Whether blood sugar is lowered or not is affected by the body’s insulin, and many patients with type 2 diabetes are obese or living with other reasons that lead to impaired islet function, which ultimately prevents the body’s blood sugar from falling, and the ability to live in lectures is insufficient, so the root cause is Seeing that the treatment of type 2 diabetes needs to start with the repair of the patient’s islet function. The research team at the University of California, San Diego is trying to develop related solutions. They try to use a single drug to reshape the insulin sensitivity of patients, and the new drug will also be expected to restart the function of insulin in diabetic patients. The human body has an enzyme substance-low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMPTP), which reduces the sensitivity of cells to insulin. The new drug developed by the Stephanie Stanford research team is mainly to inhibit the activity of LMPTP, thereby reactivating the insulin receptor on the cell surface, and the cell’s ability to regulate excess sugar will also be restarted. Obesity-related insulin resistance plays a central role in type 2 diabetes. Therefore, tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates insulin receptor (IR) is a potential therapeutic target. Low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMPTP) is a suggested insulin receptor phosphatase, but its role in the localization of insulin in living organisms has not been determined. Research shows that low molecular weight phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase (LMPTP)-the type II protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) encoded by ACP1-acts as a key promoter of insulin resistance and high-fat diet-induced diabetes. These effects are caused by LMPTP affecting insulin signals in the liver. The data shows that PTP inactivates the insulin receptor by dephosphorylating the insulin receptor and its substrate, thereby terminating insulin signaling. A promising strategy for the treatment of insulin resistance is to use drugs that target PTP to make cells sensitive to insulin. “Most research in this field has focused on one type of PTP, PTP1B, but for some reason, we decided to investigate the role of PTP. LMPTP is related to diabetes,” said Stephanie Stanford, the lead author of the study. “First, human genetic studies have shown that polymorphisms induce highly active LMPTP in ACP1 to easily induce metabolic syndrome. In addition, data show that knocking down the LMPTP content of obese mice with antisense oligonucleotides can improve glucose tolerance. “The team used LMPTP global and tissue-specific gene deletions to determine the organization of its mechanism of action.<br>At the same time, due to its pathogenesis, there is currently no way to prevent this type of diabetes. Unlike type 2 diabetes, In terms of clinical symptoms, patients with type 1 diabetes have obvious “three poly” phenomena, namely polydipsia, polyuria, and polyphagia. Diabetic ketoacidosis and acute abdomen are also typical symptoms of type 1 diabetes at the initial stage. Causes of disease: 1 Causes of Type 1 Diabetes 1. Autoimmune System Deficiency Type 1 Diabetes is considered to be a disease caused by an autoimmune response. A variety of autoimmune antibodies can be detected in the patient’s blood, such as glutamate decarboxylase antibody (GAD antibody). ), islet cell antibodies (ICA antibodies), insulin autoantibodies (IAA), etc. These abnormalities can damage the β cells responsible for secreting insulin in the human islets, resulting in insufficient insulin secretion or no insulin secretion, thereby triggering diabetes 2. Genetic factors according to the current Studies have shown that genetic defects are also one of the causes of type 1 diabetes, and this defect is manifested in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigen abnormality of the sixth pair of chromosomes in the human body. HLA is restricted by the major tissue compatibility complex (MHC). Participating in the recognition of antigens by T lymphocytes and the formation and maintenance of self-tolerance play an indispensable role in autoimmune regulation. It can be seen that HLA and type 1 diabetes have a great correlation. Type 1 diabetes has family aggregation. Studies have pointed out that if both parents have a history of diabetes, their children have a 4%-11% chance of having type 1 diabetes, and the incidence of type 1 diabetes between siblings is 6%-11%. 3. The possible causes of viral infection are based on observations. , Patients with type 1 diabetes often have a history of viral infection before the onset of diabetes, and the onset of type 1 diabetes It often appears after a viral infection. There are clinical reports that some viral antibodies have been detected in the blood of patients with type 1 diabetes, such as mumps virus, cytomegalovirus, and coxsackie B4 virus antibodies, and these viruses have also been isolated from the pancreatic islets of patients with type 1 diabetes. These studies point out that the virus may be the cause of type 1 diabetes. Fulminant Type 1 Diabetes (FT1D) is a subtype of type 1 diabetes, and its cause is largely considered to be a viral infection. 4. Milk intake during infancy . The intake of milk during infancy may lead to type 1 diabetes. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) antibodies are detected in the blood of most type 1 diabetic patients, and bovine serum albumin antibodies can precipitate with the protein with a molecular weight of 69,000 in the lysate of pancreatic β-cells. The production of antibodies is believed to be due to the permeability of the baby’s intestinal tract, which allows proteins to enter the blood circulation from the digestive tract and is used as an antigen to cause an immune response. According to experiments, rodents are not fed with milk for three months after birth, and animals with a tendency to diabetes will not show symptoms of diabetes. A study in Finland showed that breastfed babies have a low probability of developing type 1 diabetes after being fed with cow’s milk. And rodents with diabetes have higher levels of anti-BSA antibodies. However, some believe that the relationship between type 1 diabetes and milk is not clear, and there is no evidence of milk protein as the cause of type 1 diabetes, which is still controversial and needs further research. 5. Environmental factors Repeated damage to β-cells in susceptible individuals can lead to secondary anti-β-cell autoimmunity. The cause of repeated damage may be viruses, toxic substances, etc. The death of β cells will produce excessive oxygen free radicals or nitric oxide to destroy β cells. One of the rare cases: specific β-cytotoxic substances directly affect β-cells across autoimmunity, leading to massive death of β-cells. Type 2 diabetes (under the condition of insulin resistance, the insulin secreted by β cells gradually decreases, that is, the effect is weak) Type 2 diabetes is the most common and was once called adult-onset diabetes. When they discovered that LMPTP works in the liver, Stanford and his colleagues used a new type of LMPTP inhibitor to treat mice on a high-fat diet to determine the role of LMPTP in obesity-induced diabetes. They evaluated the phosphorylation of insulin receptors and downstream signaling mediators in obese mice lacking LMPTP in the liver and obese mice using LMPTP inhibitors. Stanford and colleagues found that by affecting insulin signaling in the liver, LMPTP plays a key role in the development of insulin resistance in obese bodies. LMPTP gene deletion and pharmacological inhibition in obese mice can improve glucose tolerance without affecting body weight. “We think that LMPTP may be a promising drug candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, so further research is definitely needed,” Stanford concluded. “Our long-term goal is to advance LMPTP inhibitors to human clinical trials. In this study, we did not observe significant side effects in mice using LMPTP inhibitors, but our next step is to strictly identify this compound Is it safe to use.”</p>
