        <p>prions are just misfolded proteins. When proteins are made, they then fold onto itself and make some really cool shapes. But sometimes, these proteins don’t fold properly for some reason or another. Normally, this isn’t a problem for your body because they’ll just destroy it and make another one, but sometimes, these misfolded proteins can come together and cause other normally folded proteins to become misfolded. This normal protein, we’re gonna call that PrPc, and it crashes into this misfolded protein, called PrPSc. And when they collide, the normal protein become misfolded too. And at some point, because these misfolded proteins are very sticky, they tend to bunch together and that these giant plaques that hurt the cell. This causes diseases. </p>
<p>Specifically, the one I want to talk about is called: Kuru: the laughing death. And specifically, it’s usually the women and the children who are the most affected. During stage one, they start developing neurological issues, like how you see in this picture. The boy is standing weird, and that’s not because he wants to be standing that way, but rather it’s the disease. We call this stage the ambulant stage. This is also about the stage where people get unstable emotionally and can start laughing for no reason. That’s why it’s called the laughing death. In the second stage, they start losing the ability to walk, that’s why you see him being held up. They also start experiencing these jerking like movements sometimes too. Over the course of about 12 months, the patient will then end up in the terminal stage. Here, they can barely move and they slowly lost control over everything, their brains start to shut down alongside muscle movement. And this shutdown includes the muscles for swallowing, so many of the people eventually starve to death because of the disease. However, the reason why Kuru spreads in this community is because of tradition. The tribes believe in the recycling of life energy. When one of their relatives die, they want their energy to live on within those who are alive. In fact, in the North, they will bury the dead body for several days, let the bugs and maggots grow in the body, and then dig it back up and eat the maggots since they were considered a delicacy. This also explained why this disease was so prevalent in women and children, because usually the men of their culture received the meaty and muscular parts of the dead body, like the arms and the thighs. Then, once those were eaten, the women and the children got what was left, including the brain, where most of the prion plaques were located. But what scares me the most about this disease is that we don’t have a cure for it. In fact, there are hardly any ways to destroy prions. Acid, heat, enzymes are all ineffective against it so when you get Kuru, it’s game over. Not much of a laughing matter. </p>
