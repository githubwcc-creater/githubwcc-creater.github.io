        <p>Stories of Bacteria, Fungi, and More:</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re a doctor at the ER and this patient comes in. He’s a 43 year old police officer that scratched his face on a rose thorn a few weeks ago. Over this last month, he starts getting really sick because of the scratch. You check him and you see that he’s got a really high fever, his neck is really swollen, and he’s got a big rash where the scratch was. It’s also got a lot of ooze and gross stuff coming out of it too. You admit him to the hospital, but despite your best efforts, the infection just keeps on spreading. Eventually, it’s so bad that his entire head was covered with abscesses and one of his eyes had to be removed. This man was going to die. As a last attempt though, the wife of a pharmacologist thought of something crazy. There was this new drug that some researchers were trying out on rats and it was working really well for treating conditions like these. So, she suggests that we try it on our patient. However, this drug had never been used on humans before. Within 24 hours, the fever starts to go down and his appetite returns. Within 5 days, the swelling on his neck and the rash start to go away… but soon, trouble arises. Specifically, we’re running out of the drug. Because it was experimental, the researchers that were providing us this drug didn’t make a lot of it. They were only using it on rats after all and a rat is like 300 grams, which is obviously much less than a human weighs. They even got so desperate that they tried isolating the compound out of the patient’s urine, but because there was so little of it, they eventually still ran out. Nonetheless, the patient seems to be doing fine… He’s getting better… So, with no other choice, the doctors that were treating this man decided to let him go home. He seems to be doing ok, and even if he wasn’t, there wasn’t doing well, there’s no more of the drug left. 10 days later, Patient 1 relapses and dies. Well, the patient was Albert Alexander, who died on March 15th, 1941. He was the first man to have ever received penicillin, the mystery drug that the researchers developed. </p>
<p>This is Napoleon. He had a crap ton of arsenic in his body. Specifically, someone had a piece of his hair and sent it to the US FBI. There, they analyzed it and arsenic. Now, in nature, there’s some arsenic so finding some isn’t what’s important here. What is important is the amount of arsenic. at one point, there was over 50 times as much arsenic in his system as there was in the background. 50 times. That’s not natural or good for your health. Many people knew that the British hated his guts, so it wasn’t a hard leap to consider that they would have poisoned his wine or food. But, recently, a new theory has come up: one that doesn’t involve the British. Specifically, it has to do with this disease, Gosio’s disease. In 1891, this doctor named Bartolomeo Gosio (Italian, by the way) saw that a large number of children from rich and wealthy parents were getting sick and dying of arsenic poisoning. Now, that’s particularly odd because the only place in the house that had large amounts of arsenic was the wallpaper. Specifically, this pigment called Sheele’s Green used arsenic to help with the color of the wallpaper. But it wasn’t like the children were eating the wallpaper, after all, these were the children from rich families and they tend to be well trained and have good manners. So, how in the world were they getting so much arsenic in their bodies? Well, Dr. Gosio had a thought: what happened to the arsenic when the wallpaper was broken down by mold? What if, after the mold ate up the glue in the wallpaper, it released the arsenic in the air? So he came up with an experiment: In a jar, he put in a rat, some moldy bread, and the Sheele’s green paint on the bread. If he was right, the mold would break down the bread and the paint would be released into the air. And, just as he guess, by the end of the experiment, the rat (play animation) died, giving rise to the theory of Gosio’s disease. Sheele’s green pigment on wallpaper was used to paint Napolean’s bedroom.</p>
