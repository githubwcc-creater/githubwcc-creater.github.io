        <p>In fact, bacteria are so important that they can even influence your weight. They found that fat people have a higher ratio of fermicutes to bacteroides in their microbiota than skinny people. And when they transplant the bacteria from twins, one fat and one skinny, into mice, the mice that get the bacteria from the fat twin also become fat but the mice that get it from the skinny twin do not. The reason behind this is that sometimes these bacteria from fat people break down nutrients way better than those from the skinny people. Meaning that they cause the person to absorb more of the energy from the food and hence, even though these two people are eating the same thing, the top one takes in more calories and hence, become fat. So, in other words, if someone is fat, it might be because the bacteria in their gut predisposes them to be fat. This important role for your gut bacteria is honestly really new for science. Up until recently and even now, we don’t know a lot about how these bacteria influence your heath, other than they are important. For example, If you’re taking antibiotics, you might kill a lot of the bacteria that is naturally found in your gut. These bacteria naturally compete with other bacteria in your gut and this competition actually helps keep you healthy since no one species is going to take over and cause a large scale infection. However, since antibiotics only kill some species of bacteria, the bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotics that you are taking then can grow and take over really rapidly. So, taking antibiotics might actually result in an infection. In fact, every year, there are at least 29 thousand deaths from one of these bacteria, called clostridium difficile. And because antibiotics caused this problem and these bacteria are resistant to antibiotics, more of the same antibiotics doesn’t really solve the issue. In fact, the first line of treatment is to stop using that antibiotics, as you can see there. But if you stop using the antibiotics, what do you do? How do you get rid of this problem?  Well, some researchers got thinking: So they tested this theory out by introducing gut bacteria back into patients through a technique called a fecal matter transplant or FMT for short.</p>
<p>And the results were insane. On the right, these two groups represent the people that received a different class of antibiotics to try and solve the problem. So, in other words, the doctors just fed these people more antibiotics, but a different kind. As you can see here, only about 30 percent of them actually got better. In contrast, the people who got the FMT treatment had an overall 93.8% treatment success. In fact, the new treatment was so effective that they had to stop the study because it was unethical to not give these guys with the antibiotics the FMT treatment.  What is an FMT? Fecal matter, the FM in the term, means, poop. Transplant, that’s the transfer of something from one person to another…When they get somebody’s poop, they blend it up real good, and then they filter out the poop water, and then they stick it right in ya, or they put it inside of a pill and you eat it. That’s the miracle poop. </p>
