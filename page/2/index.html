        <p>The accomplishment of reading the book “<em>The courage to be hated</em>”, published in 2015, changed my view of myself and the world. This book is a dialogue between a young man and a philosopher. It is tantamount to a scream for a young man in a difficult situation. However, the young man does not easily believe the philosopher’s point of view and keeps asking the philosopher his own questions such as: “Whose fault is our misfortune?” “Is it true?” The youth in the book used to feel inferior and lonely whose chosen job is not supported by his parents. He wants to pursue the opposite sex but cannot overcome the obstacles in his heart, and even worse he often follows orders at work. Nevertheless, his series of troubles and doubts are all solved in the dialogue with the philosopher. The process of solving this problem is painful and requires constant reflection and doubt, but fortunately, the final result is uplifting. He finally understands that the world is not changed by others, but only by himself.</p>
<p> After reading this book, I can relate to the young man: low self-esteem, quite concerned about other people’s perspectives, wanting to change but afraid, hoping to be recognized by others, and pursuing perfection and excellence. It made me understand a very crucial factor that can also be freed from communication troubles: separation. In layman’s terms, distance produces beauty. Life is not endowed by others but chosen by ourselves. Thus, we get the opportunities to decide how we live no matter how the others comment. It is not the past experience that determines our identities and characteristics, but the meaning we give to the experience. And it indeed takes a great deal of courage to look forward and be yourself.</p>

        <p>What is the major harm of white pollution?</p>
<p>“White pollution” refers to the image of life waste which comes from the usage of plastic products. However, it is difficult to dispose resulting in severe urban environmental consequences which are mainly visual pollution and potential hazards (Lambert 1).</p>
<p>The visual solution means plenty of plastic waste stewed directly into the natural environment without disposal those rubbish damage people’s stimulation and affect the entire beauty of nature (Lambert 2). For instance, when people see a mountain of waste thrown along the highway or, their mental and physical health will probably be damaged because of the overwhelming stench and disgusting picture. </p>
<p>One of the potential hazards is marine pollution. It is a combination of chemicals and trash, and most of them comes from land and is washed or thrown into the ocean. This pollution results in damage the environment, jeopardize all organisms’ health, and threaten worldwide economy (Admin 1). This trash poses dangers to both humans and animals. Fish are injured, and some animals mistake items like plastic bags for food and eat them. Small organisms feed on tiny bits of broken plastic, and absorb the chemicals from the plastic into their tissues. </p>
<p>Overall, the main hazards have great influence on creatures including both animals and human. The solutions are needed instantly to decrease the unbearable harm.</p>

        <p>In contemporary, topics about the influence of smoking never fail to attract the public’s attention, especially the one about the relationship between smoking and social problems. Loads of people suppose that tobacco is the source of cigarette, a harmful substance, therefore, it should be banned. However, views regarding this practice vary greatly from person to person. Personally, this point of view is questionable.</p>
<p>Since smoking exerts great pressure to heart, it will result in the worse capacity of blood circulation and immune system. In public, if a person is smoking, the smoke he or she breaths out will be breathed in by the people in the surrounding leading to damage in their lungs and hearts. With the spreading of smoke, more and more people have the tendency of suffering a heart disease. Thus, the increasing number of patients will cause a social problem.</p>
<p>Even though tobacco may result in the public’s problem of health, it doesn’t mean we should turn a blind eye to its benefits. Above all, tobacco industry plays a vital role in national economy. Due to the fact that taxes imposed on tobacco business contribute a great proportion to national revenue, government has more money to allocate to infrastructure, ranging from public transportation, public facilities which lays a solid foundation. Especially the case in China where taxes on tobacco business account for approximately 16% of the total tax income. Without tobacco, the development of national economy will be negatively effected. Secondly, smoking can let people feel relaxed in this fast-paced society. Because of materials contained in tobacco, it has the function of remising people’s peer pressure and make them exhilarated in the duration of smoking. Consequently, it is a way of recreation to smokers and has also become an indispensable part of their stressed life.</p>
<p>To sum up, smoking has its both advantages and drawbacks for it can jeopardize people’s physical health while help them run away from the daily grind. In order to consider two aspects, administrators can set up private smoking room so that the harm is released, and benefits are utilized meanwhile.</p>

<p>Egg Drop Essay</p>
<p>Our final design was the result of many attempt. Before the finalize, we tried to protect the egg by using foam plastic inside the container. Our attention mainly focused on the infilling at the beginning of the experiment. However, after a few times failures of dropping, we found that the filler which can buffering pressure is not the keystone, whereas the conducts used outside the box is what matters. Based on preliminary conclusions, we changed the strategy. In order to make our design in a light and protective way, we chose to settle the foam stick glued on the surface of the container. Besides, different settlements of sticks can defend from all directions. Even though the imagination is well-rounded, but in reality we still encountered problems. It is difficult to make the foam stick adhere to the box tightly, and the rope is unstrained because of the restriction of the space. A couple of sticks divide the space into different section and that result in there is not sufficient interspace for hands to move. Fortunately, we altered our steps, the sticks were finally tied to the container successfully. Therefore, the ultimate design of our group initially formed.</p>
<p>After we first dropped the egg on the third floor, the egg itself remained intact. Whereas, the moment the container was thrown out the window, one of the foam plastic sticks outside our container broke off, and another one broke when it hit the ground. Analogously, after dropping the container on the fourth floor, two of them broke. The break of the container’s shield—foam sticks was expected, and we were hoping that the force applied to the egg would be converted to the force applied to the foam by a ring of foam sticks outside the container. I think we managed to pull it off and beat expectations. If we have a chance to do this experiment again I might pay more attention to the structure of the device. We would use a more rigid arrangement of foam sticks, such as a triangular structure to ensure stability or a “井” square structure on each side of the box so that the device would be protected to the maximum extent possible. The main thing is we need more foam sticks, then fasten them around the container. </p>
<p><img src="file:///C:/Users/wangl/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif" alt="2020-11-30 22:45:51.332000"> <img src="file:///C:/Users/wangl/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.gif" alt="/private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/8140A29B-3916-45E6-BFC2-A1047FC49038/tmp/insert_image_tmp_dir/2020-12-01 00:32:28.383000.png2020-12-01 00:32:28.383000"></p>
<p>During the dropping, the gravitational potential energy transformed into mechanical kinetic energy and then when the foam stick hit the ground, it deformed, so the mechanical energy transformed again into elastic potential energy. Since the stick was deformed beyond the strain that elastic deformation persists, the stress was no longer proportional to strain, or plastic deformation occurs, so part of the sticks’ shape were damaged .Moreover, elastic potential energy is too large to be contained in the foam, the stick broke into pieces which would consume energy, thus the energy that the container would receive is lower and meanwhile the egg could be protected well. In the whole process, the position of the egg is inside the box, and nearly only bear gravity. It took 3 seconds from the fourth floor to drop to the ground, therefore, according to the formular of velocity, it is estimate that the average velocity is 4m/s. Furthermore, the mass that measured before dropping is 71g in total, because of the centrifugal force, the box was moving faster and faster. As a result, depending on all the previous information, the acceleration is considered to be 9.8m/s2.</p>

        <p>Compared to what I learned before, this movie exposes more minor players, such as Anna Brown and Galt who make crucial changes during the process of confederation. Take Anna as an example, the wife of George Brown, her existence subliminally plants the seed of open minded deep in his heart, resulting in Brown’s agreement of the grant coalition. In addition, in order to solve the key issues of political deadlock and railway, new laws need to be proposed to change the government structure. George Brown disapproves the idea of building railways as he thinks this method to achieve modernization is a theft of the public purse and corruption. Whereas, Macdonald promises Galt building railways and then he sides with Macdonald. Throughout that time, the government work extremely inefficient because of the double majority, e.g., they have arranged 50 votes to decide where the capital city of Canada should be. Overall, the main theme is sacrifice. Even though the politicians make judgements depending on their own parties’ belief, they all eventually compromise so that the very nation can survive under harsh circumstance. At the moment George Brown sitting considering whether join in the grant coalition and who will be the following leader of the new birth country, despite having being criticize Macdonald for such a long time in the newspaper, he still supposes Macdonald suits more to be the governor because of his charm. In other words, they all have the essential passion for the birth of a country, which reinforce my perspective as the unity is stronger than several parts more often than not and much more problems can be solved. After watching, I feel intoxicated when achieving the grant coalition. While Brown chooses to stand by Macdonald, sunlight streams through the window on to their faces and chairs driving the plot to its climax. Similarly, I both perceived an idea of unity from the film and Chinese history. For example, Qin Dynasty is one of the most important dynasty in Chinese history which was a unified dominant country developed by state of Qin in the late period of the Warring States. That conduct strengthened and formed better military protection for the previous China.</p>

        <p>Before entering Nanjing Foreign Language School British Columbia Academy department, I have been looking for one subject that I am passionate about. Through learning school mandatary curriculums, I found I was keen on studying biology. However, since the knowledge we learned is almost knowable from everyday life, I prefer gain those more specialized in spare time to make sure whether I am into biology. On the recommendation of a couple of seniors, they advised me to buy an entry-level access book about life science, which is written by the winner of Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology.</p>
<p>Briefly browsing the book two months ago, I set a long-term goal with time restriction based on the number of items on the catalogue. Since then, I have been working on it for approximately one month. Whenever I have day-off, I would like to spend time construing, searching keystone that author explain in each section. In the beginning, it was a bit difficult to comprehend those completely unfamiliar terms. After searching on a particular internet, the majority of questions can be answered. Nevertheless, when the internet cannot solve the problem, I will make an appointment with my school science teacher and discuss about it together, which greatly deepen my understanding and improve analytical skills.</p>
<p>During the period of reading and analyzing, my self-educated ability plays a vital role in exploring challenging field. As a result, the process I am undergoing provides me a win-win prospect, acquiring knowledge as well as skills training. Also, I wish I can remain that passion, study, challenge myself, stay in tune with what’s going on around me.</p>

        <p>“A poison tree” written by William Blake depicts the process of the growing anger in a humorous way since using loads of metaphor. The poet employs a poison tree to represent the temper in the speaker’s mind vividly which demonstrates how his feeling develops. Throughout the poem, the anger exists and gradually progresses with the story and it is recognized as one of the themes of the poem.</p>
<p>The theme of the poem is not only the anger itself but also the suppression of anger which lead to the cultivation of anger. At the beginning, the speaker expresses his temper directly by showing that he is angry about his friends and foe and the wrath is still growing as well. Meanwhile, the words also reveal that he has planted the seed of anger because of the start of this temper. After he plants it, the growth of anger is supported by his tears and fear, and they are seemed as the fertilizer of the poison tree. Therefore, he accumulates his feelings to cultivate the tree of anger by suppression. With time passing, his mood becomes more dreadful. The tree even has fruits of anger which look beckoning in order to attract foe’s attention. By the end of the poem, his anger is transformed into evilness because he is glad to see that the foe died after eating bright apples on the tree. As a result, Through the cultivation of that seed, which is nourished by the energy of the angry person, wrath grows into a mighty and destructive force.</p>
<p>The poem exposes how mood has bad influence on one’s thoughts and personality. Besides, the change between the speaker’s thoughts just because of the accumulation of his feeling. The poem does not argue that anger of itself is dangerous. Rather, it is the anger people refuse to relinquish that becomes toxic to ourselves and others.</p>

        <p>As a member of Drama club, practice we take and the eventual performance we display greatly enhance my critical thinking. More often than not, we go over scripts and discuss our personal understanding of lines. Standing in shoes of other people, trying to think of the characters’ inner thoughts are exercise we usually take. I find it a bit difficult because feeling can be figured out only based on words, thus, my analytical ability is improved through these activities. Take my final play as an example, there’s a quite contrasting turning without any other explanation. Therefore, we ought to imagine a scene so as to make two parts connected but no words are said. However, because of my and my partner’s experience is limited, we asked the teacher about the characters’ mental activity. Trying to regard this story as reality, it probably broadens my views on some events. After briefly understanding, we make a scene expressed through our eye contact and body language. All of the above efforts leas to better shows and reinforce my critical thinking at the same time.</p>

        <p>The Raven by Edger Allen Poe depicts a dark and mysterious poem in which the speaker encounter with worries over a knocking at his door and a raven. He sketches the process of accepting the loss of his beloved Lenore with loads of literature techniques, especially the symbolism, in order to show his scare and terrify. Throughout the poem, it is easy to infer that Poe attaches importance to the raven because of using the repetition. Thus, the raven is not only a talking bird in physical life, but also a symbol of repetition and loss which expose the deeper themes of grief, self-analysis and rationality.</p>
<p>The theme of grief is the most obvious symbol embodied by the raven. Also, grief is the overwhelming emotion in The Raven in which the narrator is consumed by his grief for his lost love, Lenore. At the beginning of the poem, he tries to distract himself from his sadness by reading a “volume of forgotten lore”(Poe line2). Whereas, when the raven arrives, he immediately begins asking questions about Lenore and becomes further lost in his grief at the raven’s response of “nevermore.” By the end of the poem, the narrator is seemed to be broken (Poe line100), stating that his soul will never again be “lifted” due to his sorrow (Poe line108). Poe stated that the raven itself was a symbol of grief. As a result, the whole poem is all filled with the poet’s grief of losing Lenore.</p>
<p>The Raven centers around the theme of self-analysis explored by facing and accepting the raven as the poem progressed. When the speaker grows stronger soul, he hesitates no longer to open the door (Poe, line19) instead of keeping surceasing the sorrow by reading books (Poe, line10). This confirms his confidence to start looking at himself by facing the loss. Besides, he tries to figure out why the grief comes so poignant. He sits divining with his head at ease reclining towards the raven corroborating that he is analysis himself: confronting the loss, battling with his sorrow and even begin to think whether the loss will go (Poe line75). The entire poem is all developed by his gradually analytical thinking. In other words, his views of the lost Lenore is embodied by his dealing with the raven on the chamber door. The introspect of his suffering is also the struggle that sustains the progress of “The Raven”.</p>
<p>The theme of rationality of the speaker converts into irrationality little by little due to the raven. Primordially, the narrator is rational enough to understand that Lenore is dead and he will not see her again because he wants to “surcease sorrow for the lost Lenore” (Poe, line10). When the raven first begins repeating “nevermore,” he realizes that the answer is the bird’s “only stock and store,” (Poe, line62) and he will not get another response no matter what he asks. He seems to even find the bird vaguely amusing since the bird beguiling his sad fancy into smiling (Poe, line 43). However, as the poem continues, the narrator’s irrationality increases as he asks the raven questions and takes its repeat response of “nevermore” to be a logical answer and that resulting in further lost into madness. That is why he curses the bird as a “devil” and “thing of evil” and thinking he feels angels surrounding him before sinking into his grief (Poe line83). He has clearly come undone by the end of the poem. In “The Raven”, Poe wants to show the fine line between rational thought and irrationality is broken by the raven which keeps stimulating his deeper grief.</p>
<p>All these themes are emphasized by the speaker’s loneliness which the symbol of the raven brings along. The loss of Lenore results in the speaker’s getting stuck with his grief. He tries to control the sorrow by doing analytical thinking to himself, but unfortunately the only response to his questions of analysis is nevermore, which drive him mad and irrational. Facing the raven on the chamber door, listening the answer as nevermore, when will he accept the loss of Lenore.</p>

<p>I came to your country with dreams,</p>
<p>Like colorful bubbles,                       (simile)</p>
<p>Falling on cold hard pebbles.                    (rhyme)</p>
<p>I speak your language perfectly, </p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>The squinting of your eyes, the scornful tone and raising eyebrows,   (consonance)</p>
<p>are icy water pouring on my head in December.            (metaphor)</p>
<p>Rumors about me are spreading like wild tornados,          (metaphor)</p>
<p>Tearing me to pieces:                    (personification)</p>
<p>As the glass fragments,                      (metaphor)</p>
<p>The dim color but reflects dazzling light.</p>
<p>Only because my dark skin reminds you of dark witches.         (rhyme)</p>
<p>I try to explain in your language: </p>
<p>The darkness of my skin, </p>
<p>Does not mean the darkness of my heart;</p>
<p>The accent of my English,</p>
<p>Does not mean the stupidity of my culture.               (refrain)</p>
<p>Standing still against all my soul,                 (alliteration)</p>
<p>indignant and sorrow.</p>
<p>The curtain of night devoured the earth little by little,       (personification)</p>
<p>the curling up smoke suffuses in the air.</p>
<p>Even though the crimson blood is drained,             (symbolism) </p>
<p>I won’t yield.                        (consonance)</p>
<p>My skin is kin to apatite,                     (metaphor)              </p>
<p>the darker the rarer;</p>
<p>My language is the albatross towering above the ocean,         (metaphor)  </p>
<p>Refusing to be erased.</p>
<p>Now I stand upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat,</p>
<p>go ahead,</p>
<p>though the spoondrift is seething.</p>
<p>I am the master of my language,</p>
<p>I am the navigation of my soul.</p>
