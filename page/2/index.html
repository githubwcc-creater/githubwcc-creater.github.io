        <p>As a member of Drama club, practice we take and the eventual performance we display greatly enhance my critical thinking. More often than not, we go over scripts and discuss our personal understanding of lines. Standing in shoes of other people, trying to think of the characters’ inner thoughts are exercise we usually take. I find it a bit difficult because feeling can be figured out only based on words, thus, my analytical ability is improved through these activities. Take my final play as an example, there’s a quite contrasting turning without any other explanation. Therefore, we ought to imagine a scene so as to make two parts connected but no words are said. However, because of my and my partner’s experience is limited, we asked the teacher about the characters’ mental activity. Trying to regard this story as reality, it probably broadens my views on some events. After briefly understanding, we make a scene expressed through our eye contact and body language. All of the above efforts leas to better shows and reinforce my critical thinking at the same time.</p>

        <p>The Raven by Edger Allen Poe depicts a dark and mysterious poem in which the speaker encounter with worries over a knocking at his door and a raven. He sketches the process of accepting the loss of his beloved Lenore with loads of literature techniques, especially the symbolism, in order to show his scare and terrify. Throughout the poem, it is easy to infer that Poe attaches importance to the raven because of using the repetition. Thus, the raven is not only a talking bird in physical life, but also a symbol of repetition and loss which expose the deeper themes of grief, self-analysis and rationality.</p>
<p>The theme of grief is the most obvious symbol embodied by the raven. Also, grief is the overwhelming emotion in The Raven in which the narrator is consumed by his grief for his lost love, Lenore. At the beginning of the poem, he tries to distract himself from his sadness by reading a “volume of forgotten lore”(Poe line2). Whereas, when the raven arrives, he immediately begins asking questions about Lenore and becomes further lost in his grief at the raven’s response of “nevermore.” By the end of the poem, the narrator is seemed to be broken (Poe line100), stating that his soul will never again be “lifted” due to his sorrow (Poe line108). Poe stated that the raven itself was a symbol of grief. As a result, the whole poem is all filled with the poet’s grief of losing Lenore.</p>
<p>The Raven centers around the theme of self-analysis explored by facing and accepting the raven as the poem progressed. When the speaker grows stronger soul, he hesitates no longer to open the door (Poe, line19) instead of keeping surceasing the sorrow by reading books (Poe, line10). This confirms his confidence to start looking at himself by facing the loss. Besides, he tries to figure out why the grief comes so poignant. He sits divining with his head at ease reclining towards the raven corroborating that he is analysis himself: confronting the loss, battling with his sorrow and even begin to think whether the loss will go (Poe line75). The entire poem is all developed by his gradually analytical thinking. In other words, his views of the lost Lenore is embodied by his dealing with the raven on the chamber door. The introspect of his suffering is also the struggle that sustains the progress of “The Raven”.</p>
<p>The theme of rationality of the speaker converts into irrationality little by little due to the raven. Primordially, the narrator is rational enough to understand that Lenore is dead and he will not see her again because he wants to “surcease sorrow for the lost Lenore” (Poe, line10). When the raven first begins repeating “nevermore,” he realizes that the answer is the bird’s “only stock and store,” (Poe, line62) and he will not get another response no matter what he asks. He seems to even find the bird vaguely amusing since the bird beguiling his sad fancy into smiling (Poe, line 43). However, as the poem continues, the narrator’s irrationality increases as he asks the raven questions and takes its repeat response of “nevermore” to be a logical answer and that resulting in further lost into madness. That is why he curses the bird as a “devil” and “thing of evil” and thinking he feels angels surrounding him before sinking into his grief (Poe line83). He has clearly come undone by the end of the poem. In “The Raven”, Poe wants to show the fine line between rational thought and irrationality is broken by the raven which keeps stimulating his deeper grief.</p>
<p>All these themes are emphasized by the speaker’s loneliness which the symbol of the raven brings along. The loss of Lenore results in the speaker’s getting stuck with his grief. He tries to control the sorrow by doing analytical thinking to himself, but unfortunately the only response to his questions of analysis is nevermore, which drive him mad and irrational. Facing the raven on the chamber door, listening the answer as nevermore, when will he accept the loss of Lenore.</p>

        <p>Unwind is a dystopian novel by Neal Shusterman that follows three teens running away from a government that believes “unwinding,” or body harvesting, is an alternate solution to abortions and unwanted teens. Unwinding is also a choice for extremely religious families who want to tithe one of their teens. Since unlike upbringing by their parents, the differences and similarities are formed between characters. Specifically, Connor and Lev’s intentions, attitude and destiny are somehow distinct or resemble.</p>
<p>One of the most apparent convergence is their same purpose as survival. Lev, a round protagonist, transferred from pro-life to pro-choice and finally becomes clappers. After he arrived at the graveyard, he soon finds a group he fits in where the members’ mind to the world are full of hate and organize preparation for the final explosion. Meanwhile, Connor is constantly escaping from being chased by the cop as a “fatigue” reaching the same destination as Lev does. Eventually, the two protagonists meet each other at the graveyard, which means one of their common intention is avoid being unwound. Lev, of course, comes there for another reason, but both reflect Connor and Lev standing at the same side of fighting against unwind.</p>
<p>Despite the resemblance between two protagonists, the distinctions still reveal their diverse characteristic.</p>
<p>Compared to Connor, Lev has more hatred of the world. Since Lev is the tenth and youngest\ child of his religious family, all his parents and he used to believe he is born to be a tithe to be unwound when he reaches his thirteenth birthday. However, after helping Cy-Fi finish his short trip, Lev goes through a vital change of his thoughts of world view because he finds he is betrayed before. What he thinks and feels make him become a clapper who extremely hate the world and even willing to blow himself up to destroy current society. Instead, he prevents only being unwound and disappearing. Whereas, Connor is a troubled kid at school fighting with other classmates, which both of his parents have been fed up with deciding to let him unwound. Thus, all his intention focuses on how to run away in search of a place to hide until he is 18 years old. The external conflict between Connor and people is the completely distinct thoughts of The Bill Of Life. </p>
<p>Furthermore, their destiny is totally dissimilar. Both they used to be kind children and have warmth inside their heart. However, after that car accident happened on the highway, their fate begin to change having different results. Particularly, Connor survives at Happy Jack Harvest Camp and obtains an arm from Roland. Instead, Lev choose a more radical method to end his life blowing himself up. The completely difference family environment result in this divergence. The main reason for Connor to be unwound is he is a troublemaker at school which both of his parents have been fed up with. In comparison, Lev is betrayed by his whole family including the person he trusts most, Pastor Dan. This dramatic change is too shock for Lev to accept leading to subvert his worldview and go on to the track of being clappers. In the frenzy of hate, he decides to suicide and explode the “paradise” where located unwind camp.</p>
<p>To put in another word, the humanity of mankind is changeable and go to an extreme way easily, especially for the kids. Those children like Lev betrayed by the family entirely lose trust with adults. Nevertheless, they are so young that haven’t known the cruel world they live in, and the childish in their heart is still remained. The graveyard Connor and Lev stay is like a micro community swallowing heart warmth gradually because of fear of being unwound. Under the pressure of survival, the law of jungle is demonstrated by the kids there, only killer or killed. Therefore, it’s no surprise that Lev go mad at last.</p>
<p>Connor and Lev: different, yet alike. Although the two characters differ in their attitude towards life and results of destiny, they share one crucial similarity to that volatile world. Studying on the value of human life and personal choice, these two protagonists represent two typical kinds of people in reality, round and flat in the novel of life.</p>

        <p>In the summer of 2020, before entering Nanjing Foreign Language School British Columbia Academy department, I have been looking for one subject that I am passionate about on the advice of my parents. The school curriculum at high school led me to want to study biology as I can achieve a sense of fulfilment after exploring an interesting fact. However, since the knowledge we learned was basic, I preferred gain those more specialized in spare time to make sure I was into biology. On the recommendation of a couple of seniors, I was advised to buy entry-level access book about life science, which is written by Ben Yuyou, the winner of Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology. This book was recommended because it was not hard to read, and graphics were put in the margin to help the readers understand.</p>
<p>When I began reading the book two months ago, I set a long-term goal with time restriction depending on the number of pages. Since then, I have been working on it for approximately one month. Whenever I have a day off, I would like to spend time searching terms. In the beginning, it was a bit difficult to comprehend those completely unfamiliar terms. However, after searching on the internet, the majority of questions I came up with while reading can be answered. Nevertheless, when the internet cannot solve the problem, I make an appointment with my school science teacher and discuss things together, which greatly deepens my understanding and improves analytical skills when we draw conclusions from data.</p>
<p>During the period of reading and analyzing, my ability to self-study and to use my own initiative plays a vital role in exploring challenging field. As a result, the process I am undergoing provides me a win-win prospect, acquiring knowledge as well as skills training. Also, I hope to continue this passion, study, challenge myself and stay in tune with what’s going on around me.</p>

        <p>At the end of the 18th century, John Michell and Pierre-Simon de Laplace proposed that very massive stars could become “obscure,” hiding the light that they produce. Their theory was based on the Newtonian theory of gravity, published in 1687. However, it would take until 1915, with Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity, for a theoretical framework that accurately explained black holes. </p>
<p>In 1916, in the middle of World War I, Karl Schwarzschild discovered the first full solution to the equations of general relativity. This solution describes what we now call a black hole: a mass concentrated in a point, or singularity. </p>
<p>At this point, black holes were only a mathematical oddity. They existed as solutions to the equations of general relativity, but who would believe that an object with infinite density could really exist? It took about 50 years to understand and prove that these mathematical oddities were real. </p>
<p>But until the 1960s, these oddities where not even named black holes. The name was coined by Robert Dickey, who compared the properties of these objects to the “black hole of Calcutta”. In 1756. The term “black hole” slowly became the official designation of these objects.</p>
<p>Until the early 1960s, black holes had never been observed. In 1963, a very strange object, named 3C 273, was detected. This source had an extremely luminous point about two billion lightyears away. These objects are now known as quasars, or “quasi-stellar radio sources.”</p>
<p>In 1964, another strange object, this time in our own galaxy, was discovered and named Cygnus X-1. It took the work of several outstanding scientists, to show that these objects were black holes: 3C 273 is a super-massive black hole, while Cygnus X-1 a stellar-mass one.</p>
