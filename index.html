        <p>In 1866, Mendel discovered that the laws of genetics laid the foundation for the development of modern genetics. After more than 150 years of efforts of scientists, molecular biology technology with genes has been in-depth treatment as the core of all directions of human diseases. From 1972 to 2009, gene therapy theory was first proposed as a potential solution for the treatment of human genetic diseases, to being selected as one of the top ten scientific advances in <em>Science</em> magazine in 2009. At present, gene therapy programs mainly use viral vectors to deliver exogenous genes to treat diseases. Although progress has been made, uncertain factors will induce the body to produce an immune response to the vectors, so that gene therapy programs have always existed other potential risks of disease. The emergence of gene editing technology provides new ideas for humans to reduce these potential risks. This is the timeline of the development of various gene editing methods.</p>

        <p>Types of Diabetes, Introduction to Causes and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes</p>
<p>Diabetes is an extremely common disease in today’s society. In recent decades, the number of diabetic patients worldwide has increased at an alarming rate, and it is a serious threat to human health. Why do people get diabetes? What is blood sugar level? The glucose flowing in the blood is referred to as blood sugar for short. Glucose is an indispensable source of energy for our physical and mental activities. Every second we breathe, every moment there is glucose flowing in our body. We call the glucose concentration in the blood the blood glucose level, and the unit generally used is mmol/L. Healthy people can control blood glucose fluctuations before and after eating. The blood sugar can be stabilized between 3.8~6.1mmol/L when fasting, and the blood sugar after eating will not exceed 7.8mmol/L. </p>
<p>How do people maintain stable blood sugar? This is due to several hormones in the human body: glucagon, insulin and adrenaline. When we feel hungry, or when we have just performed strenuous exercise and consume a lot of energy, blood sugar as a source of energy will be lacking, and the body will adjust to raise blood sugar levels accordingly. At this time, the two hormones glucagon and adrenaline will stimulate the body to produce glucose, and the blood sugar level will rise. As food is absorbed, starch and other products are decomposed into glucose, and the blood sugar level in the body will also increase, but these glucose will not be consumed immediately as energy. The excess glucose will be stored in the liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. If there is surplus in the cells, it will be converted into neutral fat and stored in fat cells. This process is called glucose metabolism. The hormone that is active in this metabolism is insulin. With its help, people can convert excess glucose into other forms and reduce blood sugar to the normal range. Insulin is the only hormone in the body that lowers blood sugar. Therefore, if insulin is not secreted enough, its work efficiency is not high, or the cells in the body are not sensitive enough to insulin (called “insulin resistance” in medicine), blood sugar will rise. </p>
<p>So what is insulin? Insulin is a heavy protein hormone. Secreted by pancreatic beta cells in the pancreas (process): The pancreas secretes insulin into the blood. Insulin circulates, allowing sugar to enter the cells, thereby reducing the sugar in the blood. As the blood sugar level drops, the secretion of insulin in the pancreas also drops. Glucose? Glucose is a simple sugar that is the main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose has two main sources: food and the liver. Sugar is absorbed into the blood and enters the cells with the help of insulin. Liver It can store and produce glucose. When the glucose level is low, for example, if there is no food for a period of time, the liver will break down the stored glycogen into glucose to keep the glucose level within the normal range.</p>
<p> Type 1 diabetes introduction and treatment</p>
<p>Type 1 diabetes is Autoimmune disease, also known as insulin-dependent diabetes or juvenile diabetes, patients are usually diagnosed with diabetes at a young age (mostly onset under the age of 40), under the age of 20 but not limited to this stage, any age is possible Suffer from type 1 diabetes. Unlike type 2 diabetes, the number of patients with type 1 diabetes only accounts for 5%-10% of diabetic patients. </p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes patients account for 95% of all diabetic patients. Compared with the cause of type 1 diabetes, according to the “Encyclopedia of Diabetes”, it is based on genetic factors through the action of environmental factors, leading to insulin resistance and insufficient insulin action Or due to the toxic effects of glucose. Causes: 1. Genetic mechanism: 1) Race prevalence (for example, the prevalence of diabetes in a certain race in the United States is as high as 35% after the age of 20, while the average prevalence of diabetes in the United States is 7%, but in mixed races This prevalence rate is similar to the average prevalence rate in the United States. 2) Family history/twin (one twin has type 1 diabetes, the other has a 40% chance of developing this disease; but if it is type 2 diabetes , The other has a 70% chance of developing type II diabetes.) 3) Single gene locus that is clearly related to the onset of diabetes: Insulin gene: hyperinsulinemia (amino acid variation in the original polypeptide chain of synthetic insulin, leading to Insulin-converting enzyme cannot act here to cause excessive proinsulin) Insulin receptor gene glucokinase gene mitochondrial gene mutation 2. Environmental factors 1) Obesity: A large amount of fat accumulation causes blood biochemical metabolism to be affected, and blood lipids are significantly increased. The content of free fatty acids increases; especially saturated fatty acids of this type of fatty acids will inhibit glucose from exerting its effects. 2) Age: a. With the increase of age, the pancreatic islet secretion capacity of the elderly is affected. On the one hand, the degeneration of pancreatic islet cells in the elderly increases, and the number of β cells decreases; functionally, the glucose transport ability of pancreatic islet cells is reduced, and the ability of glucose to induce insulin is also weakened. b. Insulin-mediated glucose uptake is reduced, which reduces the peripheral utilization of glucose: Most of these are in muscle tissue, which is the main peripheral tissue where insulin mediated glucose uptake. Muscle strength and mass will decrease with age. According to reports, human muscle tissue decreases by 30%-45% between the ages of 30 and 70. Adipose tissue increases by 18%-30% in men and 26% in women. 36%, the fat cell surface area increased by 19%, which is a reason for the decline in glucose utilization. Due to the decreased peripheral action of insulin, the inhibitory effect of insulin on glucose production in the liver is reduced, which increases liver glucose production. Symptoms related to type 2 diabetes: Polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, increased blood sugar, weight loss, visual impairment, gastrointestinal emptying, delayed wound healing, and type 2 diabetes treatment. The treatment goals of type 2 diabetes are mainly to increase insulin sensitivity and protect / Improve β cell function, reduce cardiovascular and microvascular complications, control glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism disorders. </p>
<p>One of the most effective methods is to increase insulin sensitivity. For patients who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, general treatment strategies include weight control and lifestyle improvements. Patients can relieve their symptoms by improving their diet, cooperating with exercise, taking drugs, injecting insulin, and performing surgery. I won’t go into details about diet and exercise here. In terms of drugs, the Ins metformin and sulfonylurea drugs invented in the last century are currently commonly used treatment drugs, but type 2 diabetes is still a very serious and incurable disease, so people are still working on research and testing more Program. The hope of curing diabetes is to reshape patients’ sensitivity to insulin. Whether blood sugar is lowered or not is affected by the body’s insulin, and many patients with type 2 diabetes are obese or living with other reasons that lead to impaired islet function, which ultimately prevents the body’s blood sugar from falling, and the ability to live in lectures is insufficient, so the root cause is Seeing that the treatment of type 2 diabetes needs to start with the repair of the patient’s islet function. The research team at the University of California, San Diego is trying to develop related solutions. They try to use a single drug to reshape the insulin sensitivity of patients, and the new drug will also be expected to restart the function of insulin in diabetic patients. The human body has an enzyme substance-low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMPTP), which reduces the sensitivity of cells to insulin. The new drug developed by the Stephanie Stanford research team is mainly to inhibit the activity of LMPTP, thereby reactivating the insulin receptor on the cell surface, and the cell’s ability to regulate excess sugar will also be restarted. Obesity-related insulin resistance plays a central role in type 2 diabetes. Therefore, tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates insulin receptor (IR) is a potential therapeutic target. Low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMPTP) is a suggested insulin receptor phosphatase, but its role in the localization of insulin in living organisms has not been determined. Research shows that low molecular weight phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase (LMPTP)-the type II protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) encoded by ACP1-acts as a key promoter of insulin resistance and high-fat diet-induced diabetes. These effects are caused by LMPTP affecting insulin signals in the liver. The data shows that PTP inactivates the insulin receptor by dephosphorylating the insulin receptor and its substrate, thereby terminating insulin signaling. A promising strategy for the treatment of insulin resistance is to use drugs that target PTP to make cells sensitive to insulin. “Most research in this field has focused on one type of PTP, PTP1B, but for some reason, we decided to investigate the role of PTP. LMPTP is related to diabetes,” said Stephanie Stanford, the lead author of the study. “First, human genetic studies have shown that polymorphisms induce highly active LMPTP in ACP1 to easily induce metabolic syndrome. In addition, data show that knocking down the LMPTP content of obese mice with antisense oligonucleotides can improve glucose tolerance. “The team used LMPTP global and tissue-specific gene deletions to determine the organization of its mechanism of action.<br>At the same time, due to its pathogenesis, there is currently no way to prevent this type of diabetes. Unlike type 2 diabetes, In terms of clinical symptoms, patients with type 1 diabetes have obvious “three poly” phenomena, namely polydipsia, polyuria, and polyphagia. Diabetic ketoacidosis and acute abdomen are also typical symptoms of type 1 diabetes at the initial stage. Causes of disease: 1 Causes of Type 1 Diabetes 1. Autoimmune System Deficiency Type 1 Diabetes is considered to be a disease caused by an autoimmune response. A variety of autoimmune antibodies can be detected in the patient’s blood, such as glutamate decarboxylase antibody (GAD antibody). ), islet cell antibodies (ICA antibodies), insulin autoantibodies (IAA), etc. These abnormalities can damage the β cells responsible for secreting insulin in the human islets, resulting in insufficient insulin secretion or no insulin secretion, thereby triggering diabetes 2. Genetic factors according to the current Studies have shown that genetic defects are also one of the causes of type 1 diabetes, and this defect is manifested in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigen abnormality of the sixth pair of chromosomes in the human body. HLA is restricted by the major tissue compatibility complex (MHC). Participating in the recognition of antigens by T lymphocytes and the formation and maintenance of self-tolerance play an indispensable role in autoimmune regulation. It can be seen that HLA and type 1 diabetes have a great correlation. Type 1 diabetes has family aggregation. Studies have pointed out that if both parents have a history of diabetes, their children have a 4%-11% chance of having type 1 diabetes, and the incidence of type 1 diabetes between siblings is 6%-11%. 3. The possible causes of viral infection are based on observations. , Patients with type 1 diabetes often have a history of viral infection before the onset of diabetes, and the onset of type 1 diabetes It often appears after a viral infection. There are clinical reports that some viral antibodies have been detected in the blood of patients with type 1 diabetes, such as mumps virus, cytomegalovirus, and coxsackie B4 virus antibodies, and these viruses have also been isolated from the pancreatic islets of patients with type 1 diabetes. These studies point out that the virus may be the cause of type 1 diabetes. Fulminant Type 1 Diabetes (FT1D) is a subtype of type 1 diabetes, and its cause is largely considered to be a viral infection. 4. Milk intake during infancy . The intake of milk during infancy may lead to type 1 diabetes. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) antibodies are detected in the blood of most type 1 diabetic patients, and bovine serum albumin antibodies can precipitate with the protein with a molecular weight of 69,000 in the lysate of pancreatic β-cells. The production of antibodies is believed to be due to the permeability of the baby’s intestinal tract, which allows proteins to enter the blood circulation from the digestive tract and is used as an antigen to cause an immune response. According to experiments, rodents are not fed with milk for three months after birth, and animals with a tendency to diabetes will not show symptoms of diabetes. A study in Finland showed that breastfed babies have a low probability of developing type 1 diabetes after being fed with cow’s milk. And rodents with diabetes have higher levels of anti-BSA antibodies. However, some believe that the relationship between type 1 diabetes and milk is not clear, and there is no evidence of milk protein as the cause of type 1 diabetes, which is still controversial and needs further research. 5. Environmental factors Repeated damage to β-cells in susceptible individuals can lead to secondary anti-β-cell autoimmunity. The cause of repeated damage may be viruses, toxic substances, etc. The death of β cells will produce excessive oxygen free radicals or nitric oxide to destroy β cells. One of the rare cases: specific β-cytotoxic substances directly affect β-cells across autoimmunity, leading to massive death of β-cells. Type 2 diabetes (under the condition of insulin resistance, the insulin secreted by β cells gradually decreases, that is, the effect is weak) Type 2 diabetes is the most common and was once called adult-onset diabetes. When they discovered that LMPTP works in the liver, Stanford and his colleagues used a new type of LMPTP inhibitor to treat mice on a high-fat diet to determine the role of LMPTP in obesity-induced diabetes. They evaluated the phosphorylation of insulin receptors and downstream signaling mediators in obese mice lacking LMPTP in the liver and obese mice using LMPTP inhibitors. Stanford and colleagues found that by affecting insulin signaling in the liver, LMPTP plays a key role in the development of insulin resistance in obese bodies. LMPTP gene deletion and pharmacological inhibition in obese mice can improve glucose tolerance without affecting body weight. “We think that LMPTP may be a promising drug candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, so further research is definitely needed,” Stanford concluded. “Our long-term goal is to advance LMPTP inhibitors to human clinical trials. In this study, we did not observe significant side effects in mice using LMPTP inhibitors, but our next step is to strictly identify this compound Is it safe to use.”</p>

        <p>The accomplishment of reading the book “<em>The courage to be hated</em>”, published in 2015, changed my view of myself and the world. This book is a dialogue between a young man and a philosopher. It is tantamount to a scream for a young man in a difficult situation. However, the young man does not easily believe the philosopher’s point of view and keeps asking the philosopher his own questions such as: “Whose fault is our misfortune?” “Is it true?” The youth in the book used to feel inferior and lonely whose chosen job is not supported by his parents. He wants to pursue the opposite sex but cannot overcome the obstacles in his heart, and even worse he often follows orders at work. Nevertheless, his series of troubles and doubts are all solved in the dialogue with the philosopher. The process of solving this problem is painful and requires constant reflection and doubt, but fortunately, the final result is uplifting. He finally understands that the world is not changed by others, but only by himself.</p>
<p> After reading this book, I can relate to the young man: low self-esteem, quite concerned about other people’s perspectives, wanting to change but afraid, hoping to be recognized by others, and pursuing perfection and excellence. It made me understand a very crucial factor that can also be freed from communication troubles: separation. In layman’s terms, distance produces beauty. Life is not endowed by others but chosen by ourselves. Thus, we get the opportunities to decide how we live no matter how the others comment. It is not the past experience that determines our identities and characteristics, but the meaning we give to the experience. And it indeed takes a great deal of courage to look forward and be yourself.</p>

        <p>What is the major harm of white pollution?</p>
<p>“White pollution” refers to the image of life waste which comes from the usage of plastic products. However, it is difficult to dispose resulting in severe urban environmental consequences which are mainly visual pollution and potential hazards (Lambert 1).</p>
<p>The visual solution means plenty of plastic waste stewed directly into the natural environment without disposal those rubbish damage people’s stimulation and affect the entire beauty of nature (Lambert 2). For instance, when people see a mountain of waste thrown along the highway or, their mental and physical health will probably be damaged because of the overwhelming stench and disgusting picture. </p>
<p>One of the potential hazards is marine pollution. It is a combination of chemicals and trash, and most of them comes from land and is washed or thrown into the ocean. This pollution results in damage the environment, jeopardize all organisms’ health, and threaten worldwide economy (Admin 1). This trash poses dangers to both humans and animals. Fish are injured, and some animals mistake items like plastic bags for food and eat them. Small organisms feed on tiny bits of broken plastic, and absorb the chemicals from the plastic into their tissues. </p>
<p>Overall, the main hazards have great influence on creatures including both animals and human. The solutions are needed instantly to decrease the unbearable harm.</p>

        <p>In contemporary, topics about the influence of smoking never fail to attract the public’s attention, especially the one about the relationship between smoking and social problems. Loads of people suppose that tobacco is the source of cigarette, a harmful substance, therefore, it should be banned. However, views regarding this practice vary greatly from person to person. Personally, this point of view is questionable.</p>
<p>Since smoking exerts great pressure to heart, it will result in the worse capacity of blood circulation and immune system. In public, if a person is smoking, the smoke he or she breaths out will be breathed in by the people in the surrounding leading to damage in their lungs and hearts. With the spreading of smoke, more and more people have the tendency of suffering a heart disease. Thus, the increasing number of patients will cause a social problem.</p>
<p>Even though tobacco may result in the public’s problem of health, it doesn’t mean we should turn a blind eye to its benefits. Above all, tobacco industry plays a vital role in national economy. Due to the fact that taxes imposed on tobacco business contribute a great proportion to national revenue, government has more money to allocate to infrastructure, ranging from public transportation, public facilities which lays a solid foundation. Especially the case in China where taxes on tobacco business account for approximately 16% of the total tax income. Without tobacco, the development of national economy will be negatively effected. Secondly, smoking can let people feel relaxed in this fast-paced society. Because of materials contained in tobacco, it has the function of remising people’s peer pressure and make them exhilarated in the duration of smoking. Consequently, it is a way of recreation to smokers and has also become an indispensable part of their stressed life.</p>
<p>To sum up, smoking has its both advantages and drawbacks for it can jeopardize people’s physical health while help them run away from the daily grind. In order to consider two aspects, administrators can set up private smoking room so that the harm is released, and benefits are utilized meanwhile.</p>

<p>Egg Drop Essay</p>
<p>Our final design was the result of many attempt. Before the finalize, we tried to protect the egg by using foam plastic inside the container. Our attention mainly focused on the infilling at the beginning of the experiment. However, after a few times failures of dropping, we found that the filler which can buffering pressure is not the keystone, whereas the conducts used outside the box is what matters. Based on preliminary conclusions, we changed the strategy. In order to make our design in a light and protective way, we chose to settle the foam stick glued on the surface of the container. Besides, different settlements of sticks can defend from all directions. Even though the imagination is well-rounded, but in reality we still encountered problems. It is difficult to make the foam stick adhere to the box tightly, and the rope is unstrained because of the restriction of the space. A couple of sticks divide the space into different section and that result in there is not sufficient interspace for hands to move. Fortunately, we altered our steps, the sticks were finally tied to the container successfully. Therefore, the ultimate design of our group initially formed.</p>
<p>After we first dropped the egg on the third floor, the egg itself remained intact. Whereas, the moment the container was thrown out the window, one of the foam plastic sticks outside our container broke off, and another one broke when it hit the ground. Analogously, after dropping the container on the fourth floor, two of them broke. The break of the container’s shield—foam sticks was expected, and we were hoping that the force applied to the egg would be converted to the force applied to the foam by a ring of foam sticks outside the container. I think we managed to pull it off and beat expectations. If we have a chance to do this experiment again I might pay more attention to the structure of the device. We would use a more rigid arrangement of foam sticks, such as a triangular structure to ensure stability or a “井” square structure on each side of the box so that the device would be protected to the maximum extent possible. The main thing is we need more foam sticks, then fasten them around the container. </p>
<p><img src="file:///C:/Users/wangl/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif" alt="2020-11-30 22:45:51.332000"> <img src="file:///C:/Users/wangl/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.gif" alt="/private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/8140A29B-3916-45E6-BFC2-A1047FC49038/tmp/insert_image_tmp_dir/2020-12-01 00:32:28.383000.png2020-12-01 00:32:28.383000"></p>
<p>During the dropping, the gravitational potential energy transformed into mechanical kinetic energy and then when the foam stick hit the ground, it deformed, so the mechanical energy transformed again into elastic potential energy. Since the stick was deformed beyond the strain that elastic deformation persists, the stress was no longer proportional to strain, or plastic deformation occurs, so part of the sticks’ shape were damaged .Moreover, elastic potential energy is too large to be contained in the foam, the stick broke into pieces which would consume energy, thus the energy that the container would receive is lower and meanwhile the egg could be protected well. In the whole process, the position of the egg is inside the box, and nearly only bear gravity. It took 3 seconds from the fourth floor to drop to the ground, therefore, according to the formular of velocity, it is estimate that the average velocity is 4m/s. Furthermore, the mass that measured before dropping is 71g in total, because of the centrifugal force, the box was moving faster and faster. As a result, depending on all the previous information, the acceleration is considered to be 9.8m/s2.</p>

        <p>Compared to what I learned before, this movie exposes more minor players, such as Anna Brown and Galt who make crucial changes during the process of confederation. Take Anna as an example, the wife of George Brown, her existence subliminally plants the seed of open minded deep in his heart, resulting in Brown’s agreement of the grant coalition. In addition, in order to solve the key issues of political deadlock and railway, new laws need to be proposed to change the government structure. George Brown disapproves the idea of building railways as he thinks this method to achieve modernization is a theft of the public purse and corruption. Whereas, Macdonald promises Galt building railways and then he sides with Macdonald. Throughout that time, the government work extremely inefficient because of the double majority, e.g., they have arranged 50 votes to decide where the capital city of Canada should be. Overall, the main theme is sacrifice. Even though the politicians make judgements depending on their own parties’ belief, they all eventually compromise so that the very nation can survive under harsh circumstance. At the moment George Brown sitting considering whether join in the grant coalition and who will be the following leader of the new birth country, despite having being criticize Macdonald for such a long time in the newspaper, he still supposes Macdonald suits more to be the governor because of his charm. In other words, they all have the essential passion for the birth of a country, which reinforce my perspective as the unity is stronger than several parts more often than not and much more problems can be solved. After watching, I feel intoxicated when achieving the grant coalition. While Brown chooses to stand by Macdonald, sunlight streams through the window on to their faces and chairs driving the plot to its climax. Similarly, I both perceived an idea of unity from the film and Chinese history. For example, Qin Dynasty is one of the most important dynasty in Chinese history which was a unified dominant country developed by state of Qin in the late period of the Warring States. That conduct strengthened and formed better military protection for the previous China.</p>

        <p>Before entering Nanjing Foreign Language School British Columbia Academy department, I have been looking for one subject that I am passionate about. Through learning school mandatary curriculums, I found I was keen on studying biology. However, since the knowledge we learned is almost knowable from everyday life, I prefer gain those more specialized in spare time to make sure whether I am into biology. On the recommendation of a couple of seniors, they advised me to buy an entry-level access book about life science, which is written by the winner of Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology.</p>
<p>Briefly browsing the book two months ago, I set a long-term goal with time restriction based on the number of items on the catalogue. Since then, I have been working on it for approximately one month. Whenever I have day-off, I would like to spend time construing, searching keystone that author explain in each section. In the beginning, it was a bit difficult to comprehend those completely unfamiliar terms. After searching on a particular internet, the majority of questions can be answered. Nevertheless, when the internet cannot solve the problem, I will make an appointment with my school science teacher and discuss about it together, which greatly deepen my understanding and improve analytical skills.</p>
<p>During the period of reading and analyzing, my self-educated ability plays a vital role in exploring challenging field. As a result, the process I am undergoing provides me a win-win prospect, acquiring knowledge as well as skills training. Also, I wish I can remain that passion, study, challenge myself, stay in tune with what’s going on around me.</p>

        <p>“A poison tree” written by William Blake depicts the process of the growing anger in a humorous way since using loads of metaphor. The poet employs a poison tree to represent the temper in the speaker’s mind vividly which demonstrates how his feeling develops. Throughout the poem, the anger exists and gradually progresses with the story and it is recognized as one of the themes of the poem.</p>
<p>The theme of the poem is not only the anger itself but also the suppression of anger which lead to the cultivation of anger. At the beginning, the speaker expresses his temper directly by showing that he is angry about his friends and foe and the wrath is still growing as well. Meanwhile, the words also reveal that he has planted the seed of anger because of the start of this temper. After he plants it, the growth of anger is supported by his tears and fear, and they are seemed as the fertilizer of the poison tree. Therefore, he accumulates his feelings to cultivate the tree of anger by suppression. With time passing, his mood becomes more dreadful. The tree even has fruits of anger which look beckoning in order to attract foe’s attention. By the end of the poem, his anger is transformed into evilness because he is glad to see that the foe died after eating bright apples on the tree. As a result, Through the cultivation of that seed, which is nourished by the energy of the angry person, wrath grows into a mighty and destructive force.</p>
<p>The poem exposes how mood has bad influence on one’s thoughts and personality. Besides, the change between the speaker’s thoughts just because of the accumulation of his feeling. The poem does not argue that anger of itself is dangerous. Rather, it is the anger people refuse to relinquish that becomes toxic to ourselves and others.</p>
