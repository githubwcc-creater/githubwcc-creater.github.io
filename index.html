        <p>The processes of DNA transcription and translation are crucial for a living cell, and their relations are inseparable. Firstly, the RNA polymerase “unzip” DNA itself to provide a template for RNA. Then following the base complementary pairing principle, single strands of DNA are replicated by mRNA which swim out of the nuclear membrane and go to ribosome after that. At ribosome RNA get translated into amino acid (not all RNA will be amino acid). The code “AUG” is the start codon of DNA translation. In contrast, reverse transcription is the process of making a double stranded DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) molecule from a single stranded RNA template. Reverse transcription by the enzyme reverse transcriptase occurs in a series of steps. Although it is very different from the normal process, reverse transcriptase is an important enzyme. It is needed for function in viruses, eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Reverse transcriptase enzymes in cells are involved in genetic diversity and in the process of aging in eukaryotic cells. In viruses, reverse transcriptase allows the virus to insert its DNA to the host cell’s DNA, forcing the cell to make more viruses.</p>

        <p>prions are just misfolded proteins. When proteins are made, they then fold onto itself and make some really cool shapes. But sometimes, these proteins don’t fold properly for some reason or another. Normally, this isn’t a problem for your body because they’ll just destroy it and make another one, but sometimes, these misfolded proteins can come together and cause other normally folded proteins to become misfolded. This normal protein, we’re gonna call that PrPc, and it crashes into this misfolded protein, called PrPSc. And when they collide, the normal protein become misfolded too. And at some point, because these misfolded proteins are very sticky, they tend to bunch together and that these giant plaques that hurt the cell. This causes diseases. </p>
<p>Specifically, the one I want to talk about is called: Kuru: the laughing death. And specifically, it’s usually the women and the children who are the most affected. During stage one, they start developing neurological issues, like how you see in this picture. The boy is standing weird, and that’s not because he wants to be standing that way, but rather it’s the disease. We call this stage the ambulant stage. This is also about the stage where people get unstable emotionally and can start laughing for no reason. That’s why it’s called the laughing death. In the second stage, they start losing the ability to walk, that’s why you see him being held up. They also start experiencing these jerking like movements sometimes too. Over the course of about 12 months, the patient will then end up in the terminal stage. Here, they can barely move and they slowly lost control over everything, their brains start to shut down alongside muscle movement. And this shutdown includes the muscles for swallowing, so many of the people eventually starve to death because of the disease. However, the reason why Kuru spreads in this community is because of tradition. The tribes believe in the recycling of life energy. When one of their relatives die, they want their energy to live on within those who are alive. In fact, in the North, they will bury the dead body for several days, let the bugs and maggots grow in the body, and then dig it back up and eat the maggots since they were considered a delicacy. This also explained why this disease was so prevalent in women and children, because usually the men of their culture received the meaty and muscular parts of the dead body, like the arms and the thighs. Then, once those were eaten, the women and the children got what was left, including the brain, where most of the prion plaques were located. But what scares me the most about this disease is that we don’t have a cure for it. In fact, there are hardly any ways to destroy prions. Acid, heat, enzymes are all ineffective against it so when you get Kuru, it’s game over. Not much of a laughing matter. </p>

        <p>In fact, bacteria are so important that they can even influence your weight. They found that fat people have a higher ratio of fermicutes to bacteroides in their microbiota than skinny people. And when they transplant the bacteria from twins, one fat and one skinny, into mice, the mice that get the bacteria from the fat twin also become fat but the mice that get it from the skinny twin do not. The reason behind this is that sometimes these bacteria from fat people break down nutrients way better than those from the skinny people. Meaning that they cause the person to absorb more of the energy from the food and hence, even though these two people are eating the same thing, the top one takes in more calories and hence, become fat. So, in other words, if someone is fat, it might be because the bacteria in their gut predisposes them to be fat. This important role for your gut bacteria is honestly really new for science. Up until recently and even now, we don’t know a lot about how these bacteria influence your heath, other than they are important. For example, If you’re taking antibiotics, you might kill a lot of the bacteria that is naturally found in your gut. These bacteria naturally compete with other bacteria in your gut and this competition actually helps keep you healthy since no one species is going to take over and cause a large scale infection. However, since antibiotics only kill some species of bacteria, the bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotics that you are taking then can grow and take over really rapidly. So, taking antibiotics might actually result in an infection. In fact, every year, there are at least 29 thousand deaths from one of these bacteria, called clostridium difficile. And because antibiotics caused this problem and these bacteria are resistant to antibiotics, more of the same antibiotics doesn’t really solve the issue. In fact, the first line of treatment is to stop using that antibiotics, as you can see there. But if you stop using the antibiotics, what do you do? How do you get rid of this problem?  Well, some researchers got thinking: So they tested this theory out by introducing gut bacteria back into patients through a technique called a fecal matter transplant or FMT for short.</p>
<p>And the results were insane. On the right, these two groups represent the people that received a different class of antibiotics to try and solve the problem. So, in other words, the doctors just fed these people more antibiotics, but a different kind. As you can see here, only about 30 percent of them actually got better. In contrast, the people who got the FMT treatment had an overall 93.8% treatment success. In fact, the new treatment was so effective that they had to stop the study because it was unethical to not give these guys with the antibiotics the FMT treatment.  What is an FMT? Fecal matter, the FM in the term, means, poop. Transplant, that’s the transfer of something from one person to another…When they get somebody’s poop, they blend it up real good, and then they filter out the poop water, and then they stick it right in ya, or they put it inside of a pill and you eat it. That’s the miracle poop. </p>

        <p>Stories of Bacteria, Fungi, and More:</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re a doctor at the ER and this patient comes in. He’s a 43 year old police officer that scratched his face on a rose thorn a few weeks ago. Over this last month, he starts getting really sick because of the scratch. You check him and you see that he’s got a really high fever, his neck is really swollen, and he’s got a big rash where the scratch was. It’s also got a lot of ooze and gross stuff coming out of it too. You admit him to the hospital, but despite your best efforts, the infection just keeps on spreading. Eventually, it’s so bad that his entire head was covered with abscesses and one of his eyes had to be removed. This man was going to die. As a last attempt though, the wife of a pharmacologist thought of something crazy. There was this new drug that some researchers were trying out on rats and it was working really well for treating conditions like these. So, she suggests that we try it on our patient. However, this drug had never been used on humans before. Within 24 hours, the fever starts to go down and his appetite returns. Within 5 days, the swelling on his neck and the rash start to go away… but soon, trouble arises. Specifically, we’re running out of the drug. Because it was experimental, the researchers that were providing us this drug didn’t make a lot of it. They were only using it on rats after all and a rat is like 300 grams, which is obviously much less than a human weighs. They even got so desperate that they tried isolating the compound out of the patient’s urine, but because there was so little of it, they eventually still ran out. Nonetheless, the patient seems to be doing fine… He’s getting better… So, with no other choice, the doctors that were treating this man decided to let him go home. He seems to be doing ok, and even if he wasn’t, there wasn’t doing well, there’s no more of the drug left. 10 days later, Patient 1 relapses and dies. Well, the patient was Albert Alexander, who died on March 15th, 1941. He was the first man to have ever received penicillin, the mystery drug that the researchers developed. </p>
<p>This is Napoleon. He had a crap ton of arsenic in his body. Specifically, someone had a piece of his hair and sent it to the US FBI. There, they analyzed it and arsenic. Now, in nature, there’s some arsenic so finding some isn’t what’s important here. What is important is the amount of arsenic. at one point, there was over 50 times as much arsenic in his system as there was in the background. 50 times. That’s not natural or good for your health. Many people knew that the British hated his guts, so it wasn’t a hard leap to consider that they would have poisoned his wine or food. But, recently, a new theory has come up: one that doesn’t involve the British. Specifically, it has to do with this disease, Gosio’s disease. In 1891, this doctor named Bartolomeo Gosio (Italian, by the way) saw that a large number of children from rich and wealthy parents were getting sick and dying of arsenic poisoning. Now, that’s particularly odd because the only place in the house that had large amounts of arsenic was the wallpaper. Specifically, this pigment called Sheele’s Green used arsenic to help with the color of the wallpaper. But it wasn’t like the children were eating the wallpaper, after all, these were the children from rich families and they tend to be well trained and have good manners. So, how in the world were they getting so much arsenic in their bodies? Well, Dr. Gosio had a thought: what happened to the arsenic when the wallpaper was broken down by mold? What if, after the mold ate up the glue in the wallpaper, it released the arsenic in the air? So he came up with an experiment: In a jar, he put in a rat, some moldy bread, and the Sheele’s green paint on the bread. If he was right, the mold would break down the bread and the paint would be released into the air. And, just as he guess, by the end of the experiment, the rat (play animation) died, giving rise to the theory of Gosio’s disease. Sheele’s green pigment on wallpaper was used to paint Napolean’s bedroom.</p>

        <p>Mitochondria (mitochondrion) is a two-layer membrane-coated organelle found in most eukaryotic cells, with a diameter of about 0.5 to 10 microns. Talking about the origin of mitochondria, one theory proposed by Lynn is called Endosymbiosis Hypothesis. This hypothesis assumes that mitochondria originated from mitochondrial ancestors that were engulfed by another gram-negative bacterium which is capable of tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport. Evidence that supports the endosymbiosis theory has been found to include: Mitochondria have an inner membrane and have their own DNA, which is similar in shape to bacterial circular DNA; Mitochondria’s DNA encodes specific proteins expressed in mitochondria; Mitochondria’s genetic code and the genetic codes of proteobacteria are more similar; mitochondrial ribosomes are similar in size and structure to bacterial ribosomes but are different from those of eukaryotes.</p>

        <p>In 1866, Mendel discovered that the laws of genetics laid the foundation for the development of modern genetics. After more than 150 years of efforts of scientists, molecular biology technology with genes has been in-depth treatment as the core of all directions of human diseases. From 1972 to 2009, gene therapy theory was first proposed as a potential solution for the treatment of human genetic diseases, to being selected as one of the top ten scientific advances in <em>Science</em> magazine in 2009. At present, gene therapy programs mainly use viral vectors to deliver exogenous genes to treat diseases. Although progress has been made, uncertain factors will induce the body to produce an immune response to the vectors, so that gene therapy programs have always existed other potential risks of disease. The emergence of gene editing technology provides new ideas for humans to reduce these potential risks. This is the timeline of the development of various gene editing methods.</p>

        <p>Types of Diabetes, Introduction to Causes and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes</p>
<p>Diabetes is an extremely common disease in today’s society. In recent decades, the number of diabetic patients worldwide has increased at an alarming rate, and it is a serious threat to human health. Why do people get diabetes? What is blood sugar level? The glucose flowing in the blood is referred to as blood sugar for short. Glucose is an indispensable source of energy for our physical and mental activities. Every second we breathe, every moment there is glucose flowing in our body. We call the glucose concentration in the blood the blood glucose level, and the unit generally used is mmol/L. Healthy people can control blood glucose fluctuations before and after eating. The blood sugar can be stabilized between 3.8~6.1mmol/L when fasting, and the blood sugar after eating will not exceed 7.8mmol/L. </p>
<p>How do people maintain stable blood sugar? This is due to several hormones in the human body: glucagon, insulin and adrenaline. When we feel hungry, or when we have just performed strenuous exercise and consume a lot of energy, blood sugar as a source of energy will be lacking, and the body will adjust to raise blood sugar levels accordingly. At this time, the two hormones glucagon and adrenaline will stimulate the body to produce glucose, and the blood sugar level will rise. As food is absorbed, starch and other products are decomposed into glucose, and the blood sugar level in the body will also increase, but these glucose will not be consumed immediately as energy. The excess glucose will be stored in the liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. If there is surplus in the cells, it will be converted into neutral fat and stored in fat cells. This process is called glucose metabolism. The hormone that is active in this metabolism is insulin. With its help, people can convert excess glucose into other forms and reduce blood sugar to the normal range. Insulin is the only hormone in the body that lowers blood sugar. Therefore, if insulin is not secreted enough, its work efficiency is not high, or the cells in the body are not sensitive enough to insulin (called “insulin resistance” in medicine), blood sugar will rise. </p>
<p>So what is insulin? Insulin is a heavy protein hormone. Secreted by pancreatic beta cells in the pancreas (process): The pancreas secretes insulin into the blood. Insulin circulates, allowing sugar to enter the cells, thereby reducing the sugar in the blood. As the blood sugar level drops, the secretion of insulin in the pancreas also drops. Glucose? Glucose is a simple sugar that is the main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose has two main sources: food and the liver. Sugar is absorbed into the blood and enters the cells with the help of insulin. Liver It can store and produce glucose. When the glucose level is low, for example, if there is no food for a period of time, the liver will break down the stored glycogen into glucose to keep the glucose level within the normal range.</p>
<p> Type 1 diabetes introduction and treatment</p>
<p>Type 1 diabetes is Autoimmune disease, also known as insulin-dependent diabetes or juvenile diabetes, patients are usually diagnosed with diabetes at a young age (mostly onset under the age of 40), under the age of 20 but not limited to this stage, any age is possible Suffer from type 1 diabetes. Unlike type 2 diabetes, the number of patients with type 1 diabetes only accounts for 5%-10% of diabetic patients. </p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes patients account for 95% of all diabetic patients. Compared with the cause of type 1 diabetes, according to the “Encyclopedia of Diabetes”, it is based on genetic factors through the action of environmental factors, leading to insulin resistance and insufficient insulin action Or due to the toxic effects of glucose. Causes: 1. Genetic mechanism: 1) Race prevalence (for example, the prevalence of diabetes in a certain race in the United States is as high as 35% after the age of 20, while the average prevalence of diabetes in the United States is 7%, but in mixed races This prevalence rate is similar to the average prevalence rate in the United States. 2) Family history/twin (one twin has type 1 diabetes, the other has a 40% chance of developing this disease; but if it is type 2 diabetes , The other has a 70% chance of developing type II diabetes.) 3) Single gene locus that is clearly related to the onset of diabetes: Insulin gene: hyperinsulinemia (amino acid variation in the original polypeptide chain of synthetic insulin, leading to Insulin-converting enzyme cannot act here to cause excessive proinsulin) Insulin receptor gene glucokinase gene mitochondrial gene mutation 2. Environmental factors 1) Obesity: A large amount of fat accumulation causes blood biochemical metabolism to be affected, and blood lipids are significantly increased. The content of free fatty acids increases; especially saturated fatty acids of this type of fatty acids will inhibit glucose from exerting its effects. 2) Age: a. With the increase of age, the pancreatic islet secretion capacity of the elderly is affected. On the one hand, the degeneration of pancreatic islet cells in the elderly increases, and the number of β cells decreases; functionally, the glucose transport ability of pancreatic islet cells is reduced, and the ability of glucose to induce insulin is also weakened. b. Insulin-mediated glucose uptake is reduced, which reduces the peripheral utilization of glucose: Most of these are in muscle tissue, which is the main peripheral tissue where insulin mediated glucose uptake. Muscle strength and mass will decrease with age. According to reports, human muscle tissue decreases by 30%-45% between the ages of 30 and 70. Adipose tissue increases by 18%-30% in men and 26% in women. 36%, the fat cell surface area increased by 19%, which is a reason for the decline in glucose utilization. Due to the decreased peripheral action of insulin, the inhibitory effect of insulin on glucose production in the liver is reduced, which increases liver glucose production. Symptoms related to type 2 diabetes: Polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, increased blood sugar, weight loss, visual impairment, gastrointestinal emptying, delayed wound healing, and type 2 diabetes treatment. The treatment goals of type 2 diabetes are mainly to increase insulin sensitivity and protect / Improve β cell function, reduce cardiovascular and microvascular complications, control glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism disorders. </p>
<p>One of the most effective methods is to increase insulin sensitivity. For patients who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, general treatment strategies include weight control and lifestyle improvements. Patients can relieve their symptoms by improving their diet, cooperating with exercise, taking drugs, injecting insulin, and performing surgery. I won’t go into details about diet and exercise here. In terms of drugs, the Ins metformin and sulfonylurea drugs invented in the last century are currently commonly used treatment drugs, but type 2 diabetes is still a very serious and incurable disease, so people are still working on research and testing more Program. The hope of curing diabetes is to reshape patients’ sensitivity to insulin. Whether blood sugar is lowered or not is affected by the body’s insulin, and many patients with type 2 diabetes are obese or living with other reasons that lead to impaired islet function, which ultimately prevents the body’s blood sugar from falling, and the ability to live in lectures is insufficient, so the root cause is Seeing that the treatment of type 2 diabetes needs to start with the repair of the patient’s islet function. The research team at the University of California, San Diego is trying to develop related solutions. They try to use a single drug to reshape the insulin sensitivity of patients, and the new drug will also be expected to restart the function of insulin in diabetic patients. The human body has an enzyme substance-low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMPTP), which reduces the sensitivity of cells to insulin. The new drug developed by the Stephanie Stanford research team is mainly to inhibit the activity of LMPTP, thereby reactivating the insulin receptor on the cell surface, and the cell’s ability to regulate excess sugar will also be restarted. Obesity-related insulin resistance plays a central role in type 2 diabetes. Therefore, tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates insulin receptor (IR) is a potential therapeutic target. Low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMPTP) is a suggested insulin receptor phosphatase, but its role in the localization of insulin in living organisms has not been determined. Research shows that low molecular weight phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase (LMPTP)-the type II protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) encoded by ACP1-acts as a key promoter of insulin resistance and high-fat diet-induced diabetes. These effects are caused by LMPTP affecting insulin signals in the liver. The data shows that PTP inactivates the insulin receptor by dephosphorylating the insulin receptor and its substrate, thereby terminating insulin signaling. A promising strategy for the treatment of insulin resistance is to use drugs that target PTP to make cells sensitive to insulin. “Most research in this field has focused on one type of PTP, PTP1B, but for some reason, we decided to investigate the role of PTP. LMPTP is related to diabetes,” said Stephanie Stanford, the lead author of the study. “First, human genetic studies have shown that polymorphisms induce highly active LMPTP in ACP1 to easily induce metabolic syndrome. In addition, data show that knocking down the LMPTP content of obese mice with antisense oligonucleotides can improve glucose tolerance. “The team used LMPTP global and tissue-specific gene deletions to determine the organization of its mechanism of action.<br>At the same time, due to its pathogenesis, there is currently no way to prevent this type of diabetes. Unlike type 2 diabetes, In terms of clinical symptoms, patients with type 1 diabetes have obvious “three poly” phenomena, namely polydipsia, polyuria, and polyphagia. Diabetic ketoacidosis and acute abdomen are also typical symptoms of type 1 diabetes at the initial stage. Causes of disease: 1 Causes of Type 1 Diabetes 1. Autoimmune System Deficiency Type 1 Diabetes is considered to be a disease caused by an autoimmune response. A variety of autoimmune antibodies can be detected in the patient’s blood, such as glutamate decarboxylase antibody (GAD antibody). ), islet cell antibodies (ICA antibodies), insulin autoantibodies (IAA), etc. These abnormalities can damage the β cells responsible for secreting insulin in the human islets, resulting in insufficient insulin secretion or no insulin secretion, thereby triggering diabetes 2. Genetic factors according to the current Studies have shown that genetic defects are also one of the causes of type 1 diabetes, and this defect is manifested in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigen abnormality of the sixth pair of chromosomes in the human body. HLA is restricted by the major tissue compatibility complex (MHC). Participating in the recognition of antigens by T lymphocytes and the formation and maintenance of self-tolerance play an indispensable role in autoimmune regulation. It can be seen that HLA and type 1 diabetes have a great correlation. Type 1 diabetes has family aggregation. Studies have pointed out that if both parents have a history of diabetes, their children have a 4%-11% chance of having type 1 diabetes, and the incidence of type 1 diabetes between siblings is 6%-11%. 3. The possible causes of viral infection are based on observations. , Patients with type 1 diabetes often have a history of viral infection before the onset of diabetes, and the onset of type 1 diabetes It often appears after a viral infection. There are clinical reports that some viral antibodies have been detected in the blood of patients with type 1 diabetes, such as mumps virus, cytomegalovirus, and coxsackie B4 virus antibodies, and these viruses have also been isolated from the pancreatic islets of patients with type 1 diabetes. These studies point out that the virus may be the cause of type 1 diabetes. Fulminant Type 1 Diabetes (FT1D) is a subtype of type 1 diabetes, and its cause is largely considered to be a viral infection. 4. Milk intake during infancy . The intake of milk during infancy may lead to type 1 diabetes. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) antibodies are detected in the blood of most type 1 diabetic patients, and bovine serum albumin antibodies can precipitate with the protein with a molecular weight of 69,000 in the lysate of pancreatic β-cells. The production of antibodies is believed to be due to the permeability of the baby’s intestinal tract, which allows proteins to enter the blood circulation from the digestive tract and is used as an antigen to cause an immune response. According to experiments, rodents are not fed with milk for three months after birth, and animals with a tendency to diabetes will not show symptoms of diabetes. A study in Finland showed that breastfed babies have a low probability of developing type 1 diabetes after being fed with cow’s milk. And rodents with diabetes have higher levels of anti-BSA antibodies. However, some believe that the relationship between type 1 diabetes and milk is not clear, and there is no evidence of milk protein as the cause of type 1 diabetes, which is still controversial and needs further research. 5. Environmental factors Repeated damage to β-cells in susceptible individuals can lead to secondary anti-β-cell autoimmunity. The cause of repeated damage may be viruses, toxic substances, etc. The death of β cells will produce excessive oxygen free radicals or nitric oxide to destroy β cells. One of the rare cases: specific β-cytotoxic substances directly affect β-cells across autoimmunity, leading to massive death of β-cells. Type 2 diabetes (under the condition of insulin resistance, the insulin secreted by β cells gradually decreases, that is, the effect is weak) Type 2 diabetes is the most common and was once called adult-onset diabetes. When they discovered that LMPTP works in the liver, Stanford and his colleagues used a new type of LMPTP inhibitor to treat mice on a high-fat diet to determine the role of LMPTP in obesity-induced diabetes. They evaluated the phosphorylation of insulin receptors and downstream signaling mediators in obese mice lacking LMPTP in the liver and obese mice using LMPTP inhibitors. Stanford and colleagues found that by affecting insulin signaling in the liver, LMPTP plays a key role in the development of insulin resistance in obese bodies. LMPTP gene deletion and pharmacological inhibition in obese mice can improve glucose tolerance without affecting body weight. “We think that LMPTP may be a promising drug candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, so further research is definitely needed,” Stanford concluded. “Our long-term goal is to advance LMPTP inhibitors to human clinical trials. In this study, we did not observe significant side effects in mice using LMPTP inhibitors, but our next step is to strictly identify this compound Is it safe to use.”</p>

        <p>The accomplishment of reading the book “<em>The courage to be hated</em>”, published in 2015, changed my view of myself and the world. This book is a dialogue between a young man and a philosopher. It is tantamount to a scream for a young man in a difficult situation. However, the young man does not easily believe the philosopher’s point of view and keeps asking the philosopher his own questions such as: “Whose fault is our misfortune?” “Is it true?” The youth in the book used to feel inferior and lonely whose chosen job is not supported by his parents. He wants to pursue the opposite sex but cannot overcome the obstacles in his heart, and even worse he often follows orders at work. Nevertheless, his series of troubles and doubts are all solved in the dialogue with the philosopher. The process of solving this problem is painful and requires constant reflection and doubt, but fortunately, the final result is uplifting. He finally understands that the world is not changed by others, but only by himself.</p>
<p> After reading this book, I can relate to the young man: low self-esteem, quite concerned about other people’s perspectives, wanting to change but afraid, hoping to be recognized by others, and pursuing perfection and excellence. It made me understand a very crucial factor that can also be freed from communication troubles: separation. In layman’s terms, distance produces beauty. Life is not endowed by others but chosen by ourselves. Thus, we get the opportunities to decide how we live no matter how the others comment. It is not the past experience that determines our identities and characteristics, but the meaning we give to the experience. And it indeed takes a great deal of courage to look forward and be yourself.</p>
