        <p>Unwind is a dystopian novel by Neal Shusterman that follows three teens running away from a government that believes “unwinding,” or body harvesting, is an alternate solution to abortions and unwanted teens. Unwinding is also a choice for extremely religious families who want to tithe one of their teens. Since unlike upbringing by their parents, the differences and similarities are formed between characters. Specifically, Connor and Lev’s intentions, attitude and destiny are somehow distinct or resemble.</p>
<p>One of the most apparent convergence is their same purpose as survival. Lev, a round protagonist, transferred from pro-life to pro-choice and finally becomes clappers. After he arrived at the graveyard, he soon finds a group he fits in where the members’ mind to the world are full of hate and organize preparation for the final explosion. Meanwhile, Connor is constantly escaping from being chased by the cop as a “fatigue” reaching the same destination as Lev does. Eventually, the two protagonists meet each other at the graveyard, which means one of their common intention is avoid being unwound. Lev, of course, comes there for another reason, but both reflect Connor and Lev standing at the same side of fighting against unwind.</p>
<p>Despite the resemblance between two protagonists, the distinctions still reveal their diverse characteristic.</p>
<p>Compared to Connor, Lev has more hatred of the world. Since Lev is the tenth and youngest\ child of his religious family, all his parents and he used to believe he is born to be a tithe to be unwound when he reaches his thirteenth birthday. However, after helping Cy-Fi finish his short trip, Lev goes through a vital change of his thoughts of world view because he finds he is betrayed before. What he thinks and feels make him become a clapper who extremely hate the world and even willing to blow himself up to destroy current society. Instead, he prevents only being unwound and disappearing. Whereas, Connor is a troubled kid at school fighting with other classmates, which both of his parents have been fed up with deciding to let him unwound. Thus, all his intention focuses on how to run away in search of a place to hide until he is 18 years old. The external conflict between Connor and people is the completely distinct thoughts of The Bill Of Life. </p>
<p>Furthermore, their destiny is totally dissimilar. Both they used to be kind children and have warmth inside their heart. However, after that car accident happened on the highway, their fate begin to change having different results. Particularly, Connor survives at Happy Jack Harvest Camp and obtains an arm from Roland. Instead, Lev choose a more radical method to end his life blowing himself up. The completely difference family environment result in this divergence. The main reason for Connor to be unwound is he is a troublemaker at school which both of his parents have been fed up with. In comparison, Lev is betrayed by his whole family including the person he trusts most, Pastor Dan. This dramatic change is too shock for Lev to accept leading to subvert his worldview and go on to the track of being clappers. In the frenzy of hate, he decides to suicide and explode the “paradise” where located unwind camp.</p>
<p>To put in another word, the humanity of mankind is changeable and go to an extreme way easily, especially for the kids. Those children like Lev betrayed by the family entirely lose trust with adults. Nevertheless, they are so young that haven’t known the cruel world they live in, and the childish in their heart is still remained. The graveyard Connor and Lev stay is like a micro community swallowing heart warmth gradually because of fear of being unwound. Under the pressure of survival, the law of jungle is demonstrated by the kids there, only killer or killed. Therefore, it’s no surprise that Lev go mad at last.</p>
<p>Connor and Lev: different, yet alike. Although the two characters differ in their attitude towards life and results of destiny, they share one crucial similarity to that volatile world. Studying on the value of human life and personal choice, these two protagonists represent two typical kinds of people in reality, round and flat in the novel of life.</p>

        <p>In the summer of 2020, before entering Nanjing Foreign Language School British Columbia Academy department, I have been looking for one subject that I am passionate about on the advice of my parents. The school curriculum at high school led me to want to study biology as I can achieve a sense of fulfilment after exploring an interesting fact. However, since the knowledge we learned was basic, I preferred gain those more specialized in spare time to make sure I was into biology. On the recommendation of a couple of seniors, I was advised to buy entry-level access book about life science, which is written by Ben Yuyou, the winner of Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology. This book was recommended because it was not hard to read, and graphics were put in the margin to help the readers understand.</p>
<p>When I began reading the book two months ago, I set a long-term goal with time restriction depending on the number of pages. Since then, I have been working on it for approximately one month. Whenever I have a day off, I would like to spend time searching terms. In the beginning, it was a bit difficult to comprehend those completely unfamiliar terms. However, after searching on the internet, the majority of questions I came up with while reading can be answered. Nevertheless, when the internet cannot solve the problem, I make an appointment with my school science teacher and discuss things together, which greatly deepens my understanding and improves analytical skills when we draw conclusions from data.</p>
<p>During the period of reading and analyzing, my ability to self-study and to use my own initiative plays a vital role in exploring challenging field. As a result, the process I am undergoing provides me a win-win prospect, acquiring knowledge as well as skills training. Also, I hope to continue this passion, study, challenge myself and stay in tune with what’s going on around me.</p>

        <p>At the end of the 18th century, John Michell and Pierre-Simon de Laplace proposed that very massive stars could become “obscure,” hiding the light that they produce. Their theory was based on the Newtonian theory of gravity, published in 1687. However, it would take until 1915, with Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity, for a theoretical framework that accurately explained black holes. </p>
<p>In 1916, in the middle of World War I, Karl Schwarzschild discovered the first full solution to the equations of general relativity. This solution describes what we now call a black hole: a mass concentrated in a point, or singularity. </p>
<p>At this point, black holes were only a mathematical oddity. They existed as solutions to the equations of general relativity, but who would believe that an object with infinite density could really exist? It took about 50 years to understand and prove that these mathematical oddities were real. </p>
<p>But until the 1960s, these oddities where not even named black holes. The name was coined by Robert Dickey, who compared the properties of these objects to the “black hole of Calcutta”. In 1756. The term “black hole” slowly became the official designation of these objects.</p>
<p>Until the early 1960s, black holes had never been observed. In 1963, a very strange object, named 3C 273, was detected. This source had an extremely luminous point about two billion lightyears away. These objects are now known as quasars, or “quasi-stellar radio sources.”</p>
<p>In 1964, another strange object, this time in our own galaxy, was discovered and named Cygnus X-1. It took the work of several outstanding scientists, to show that these objects were black holes: 3C 273 is a super-massive black hole, while Cygnus X-1 a stellar-mass one.</p>

        <p>“A poison tree” written by William Blake depicts the process of the growing anger in a humorous way since using loads of metaphor. The poet employs a poison tree to represent the temper in the speaker’s mind vividly which demonstrates how his feeling develops. Throughout the poem, the anger exists and gradually progresses with the story and it is recognized as one of the themes of the poem.</p>
<p>The theme of the poem is not only the anger itself but also the suppression of anger which lead to the cultivation of anger. At the beginning, the speaker expresses his temper directly by showing that he is angry about his friends and foe and the wrath is still growing as well. Meanwhile, the words also reveal that he has planted the seed of anger because of the start of this temper. After he plants it, the growth of anger is supported by his tears and fear, and they are seemed as the fertilizer of the poison tree. Therefore, he accumulates his feelings to cultivate the tree of anger by suppression. With time passing, his mood becomes more dreadful. The tree even has fruits of anger which look beckoning in order to attract foe’s attention. By the end of the poem, his anger is transformed into evilness because he is glad to see that the foe died after eating bright apples on the tree. As a result, Through the cultivation of that seed, which is nourished by the energy of the angry person, wrath grows into a mighty and destructive force.</p>
<p>The poem exposes how mood has bad influence on one’s thoughts and personality. Besides, the change between the speaker’s thoughts just because of the accumulation of his feeling. The poem does not argue that anger of itself is dangerous. Rather, it is the anger people refuse to relinquish that becomes toxic to ourselves and others.</p>
